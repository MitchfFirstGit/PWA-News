        data:'<div> <p>When we are stuck with a problem, a usual strategy is to start over from scratch. Redoing the problem from the beginning allows us to avoid possible previous errors that may have gone unnoticed and have a better perspective of how and why the problem occurs.</p> <p>In the field of technology, this strategy also applies.</p> <p>Is your computer going slow or does it not respond? <strong>Try restarting the computer</strong>.</p> <p>Doesn\'t work the program? <strong>Kill it and run it again</strong>.</p> <figure><img src=\'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CObvZ_vCr6-NHex0v_-lvA.jpeg\'> </figure> <p>Let\'s talk about why restarting the computer is such an effective solution.<br>First, a computer has two different types of memory:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Non-volatile memory</strong> allows you to store data in the long term even when you turn off the computer. As a disadvantage, this type of memory is (comparatively) slow. Some examples can be a hard disk, an optical disc (CD, DVD or Bluray) or a USB stick.</li> <li> <strong>Volatile memory</strong> is very fast but it requires energy continuously to maintain its contents. Because of its speed, volatile memory is used as the working memory of the computer.</li> </ul> <p>This working memory is managed by the operating system, which controls which processes are running and allocates a space to each process. Each process stores in this space the data it is manipulating at this moment and requests resources from the operating system (such as more memory, access to the CPU or access to a peripheral) that it must release when it no longer needs them.</p> <p>A program can have programming errors that cause the computer to behave in an unstable way:</p> <ul> <li>For example, a programming error can cause a program to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU without doing anything and slowing down the rest of the processes.</li> <li>Other programming errors focus on an inadequate use of resources: a process requests a large amount of resources, or is making small requests over time but without releasing resources previously obtained. The final result is that the rest of the processes have few available resources and must wait until they are free. In particular, memory management can be a problematic area. In addition to hoarding memory without releasing it, a process may try to access memory that either had not requested or had previously released. This erroneous access can modify the data of the process in an unexpected way or, in more extreme cases, modify the data of other processes or the binary code of some process.</li> <li>The operating system can also have its own defects that cause resources to be permanently blocked without being used or processes that end their execution but still occupy resources.</li> </ul> <p>The reboot of a computer is a way to repair the working memory \'in a forced way\': eliminating it and starting from scratch. Using this method, it is not necessary to worry about the cause of the problem: we return to a \'correct\' state of the working memory and, if the same circumstances that led to the error do not happen again, they will not happen again.</p> <h4>Thus, restarting a computer is so effective for three reasons:</h4> <ol> <li>Because it serves to solve different types of problems at the same time: accumulation of resources, zombie processes, programs that have entered infinite loop, corruption of memory, etc.</li> <li>Because we do not need to spend time diagnosing the cause of the problem.</li> <li>Because if the error appeared due to a combination of unusual circumstances, it will generally not occur again and it will appear that we have \'fixed\' the problem.</li> </ol> <p>However, it must be borne in mind that restarting is not a solution to all problems. For example, it does not solve hardware problems or eliminate malware (if it exists). And it will not solve the error if our computer is not powerful enough, either because we run too many programs when starting the computer or because the program we want to use needs more resources than we have.</p> </div>'

        data: `<div> <p>By Kevin Sara, Venture Partner, Aster</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7V-Uqfq5uQENMp_-rNtNUw.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Dozens of start-ups have emerged over the past few years boldly announcing we have the technology; flying cars are here (or almost). Serious money is being thrown at electric and hybrid aviation, and credible backers are not lacking. Even the incumbent aircraft manufacturers are backing start-ups and launching their own in-house development programs. At the same time, the detractors say yes, maybe one day we'll fly electric, but not anytime soon, mostly due to limitations of current battery performance.</p> <p>Over the past 30 years I've experienced some fundamental industry transformations as a banker, investor and entrepreneur. I've seen technology innovation fundamentally transform massive industries such as telecommunications, computing and energy.</p> <p>Today, I am seeing the signs of such a transformation in aviation. This article looks at the background to electric aviation, the challenges it faces today, and some indications about where attractive investment opportunities are likely to emerge.</p> <h4>1884: Electric Airships</h4> <p>It is well known that the electric car made a brief appearance at the beginning of the 20th century, only to be overwhelmed by the superior performance range of gasoline-powered vehicles.</p> <p>Less known is the fact that the first powered flights were electrically powered and with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) capability The first powered aircraft, the dirigible 'La France,' flew an 8 km trip around Chalais Meudon in 1884, using bespoke electric motors powered by a zinc-chlorine battery with an energy density of around 30 Wh/kg. Despite a series of successful flights, the aircraft's range was too limited by its batteries to be further developed, and the glory days of the Zeppelin era were powered by diesel. Gasoline and other oil derivatives have reigned over aviation ever since.</p> <p>Why? Because fossil fuels simply pack in so much more energy than batteries for a given weight and aircraft range is highly sensitive to the energy density of its propulsive fuel, as described by the Breguet range equation. Electric 'fuel' is further disadvantaged compared to conventional fuels because batteries do not lose weight as they discharge, further reducing range compared to combustible fuels.</p> <h4>1973: Electric Airplanes</h4> <p>It was not until the first oil crisis that electric powered aircraft made its reappearance: in October 1973 the first electric airplane (fixed-wings) flight took place in Austria based on a repurposed glider and was powered by VARTA nickel-cadmium batteries and a Bosch electric motor (borrowed from a forklift). The flight lasted for 14 minutes and achieved an altitude of 360 meters. As the oil crisis abated, so did interest in electric aviation. Only half dozen or so electric airplane projects had flown by the end of the last century.</p> <p>In more recent times, an important catalyst for the revival of electric aviation has been NASA's <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/centennial_challenges/pastchallenges/index.html'>Centennial Challenges</a> program, a series of innovation prizes launched to mark the Centennial of the Wright Brother's first powered airplane flight in 1903. In particular, the <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/centennial_challenges/general_aviation/index.html'>Green Flight Challenge</a>, designed to push the limits of energy efficiency of flight and which featured the largest cash prize ever awarded in aviation history (total purse of $1.65 million, sponsored by Google), drew 14 entrants. The challenge was to fly 200 miles in less than 2 hours using less than a gallon of fuel (or energy equivalent) per passenger. In 2011, the contest was won by the Slovenian Pipistrel flying an all-electric airplane, using lithium polymer cells with an energy density of 173 Whr/kg. <a href='https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/'>Pipistrel</a> remains one of market leaders for electric light aircraft and is currently developing an eVTOL (as a partner of the <a href='https://www.uber.com/gb/en/elevate/'>UBER Elevate</a> initiative).</p> <p>The Green Flight Challenge illustrated that electric aviation had come of age; and that battery technology and electrical propulsion systems had become sufficiently performant, at least for small electric aircraft.</p> <h4>2009-11: Electric Helicopters</h4> <p>Vertical take-off and landing aircraft are more demanding on power sources than conventional aircraft, which benefit more from the forces of lift to stay aloft. It was not until 2009 that a fully electric helicopter was developed and flown in 2011 by Pascal Chr&#233;tien and <a href='http://newsite.solutionf.fr/'>Solution F</a> in France, as a demonstrator. The aircraft was powered by <a href='http://kokam.com/'>Kokam</a> lithium cobalt pouch cells which had an energy density of 160 Wh/kg. So even for helicopters, battery technology had reached a degree of maturity sufficient at least for short flights.</p> <h3>Flying Cars, electric and hybrid airplanes</h3> <p>These clear demonstrations of the capabilities of electric propulsion and battery performance heralded a new era in aviation and drew entrepreneurs, capital and new ideas to the sector, many driven by a 'clean tech' ethos. For example, <a href='http://www.jobyaviation.com/'>Joby Aviation</a> ('...advancing the transition to sustainable aviation') was founded in 2009, <a href='https://kittyhawk.aero/'>Kitty Hawk</a> in 2010 ('...we will improve our urban and natural environments with efficient and reliable mobility'), <a href='https://www.volocopter.com/en/company/'>Volocopter</a> in 2012 ('a green helicopter'), and <a href='https://zunum.aero/#About-us'>Zunum</a> in 2013 ('...get anywhere fast, and leave behind a healthy planet').</p> <p>Some of the incumbent manufacturers took notice of the potential of electrification around this time as well. Sikorsky (now part of <a href='https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/sikorsky/sikorsky-commercial-aircraft-and-services.html'>Lockheed Martin</a>) attempted to retrofit an existing product, replacing the thermal engine with an electric motors and batteries. And at the end of 2010, a 'skunkworks' project was initiated at AgustaWestland in Italy (now <a href='https://www.leonardocompany.com/'>Leonardo</a>) to develop a fully electric tiltrotor eVTOL as a technology demonstrator. After test flights in 2011, the aircraft was revealed to the public in 2013. <a href='https://www.airbus.com/'>Airbus</a> developed a 2 seater all electric demostrator (the 'E-Fan') which flew in 2014.</p> <p>During this period played a key role in promoting the idea of electric and distributed propulsion, releasing several conceptual designs and funding a sub-scale tilt-wing hybrid demonstrator ('Greased Lightning') which flew in 2015.</p> <h3>Drones</h3> <p>And another force came into play during this period: drones. As consumer drones increased in capability with better batteries and higher payloads, the commercial potential became apparent. New markets in aerial photography and surveying, inspection, agriculture, and security have been evolving quickly, and market overlap with helicopters is already apparent. Off-the-shelf drone technology also allows the rapid prototyping of new eVTOL concepts, and the push for delivery drones is forcing regulatory bodies to put in place air traffic management systems&#8202;-&#8202;which will be essential for the eventual deployment of 'flying cars'.</p> <h3>UBER Elevate</h3> <p>Perhaps the biggest catalyst for electric aviation has come from the UBER Elevate initiative. Launched by the publication of a <a href='https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf'>White Paper</a> in 2016, UBER proposed to develop an ecosystem for urban air mobility as an extension of its existing 'on-demand' ground mobility services. Subsequent conferences and industry gatherings have fleshed out a full vision of the ecosystem and design requirements (eVTOL common reference models) have been published. UBER has engaged closely with aircraft manufacturers (including <a href='https://embraerx.embraer.com/global/en'>EMBRAER</a>, <a href='https://www.bellflight.com/'>BELL</a>, <a href='https://www.aurora.aero/'>BOEING/Aurora</a>, <a href='https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/'>Pipistrel</a> and <a href='https://www.karemaircraft.com/'>KAREM</a>) and the cities of Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth, with the aim of launching commercial operations in 2023. UBER's vehicle requirements will only accommodate fully electric aircraft and vertiport specifications do not allow for combustible fuel.</p> <p>The promise of a huge market facilitated by UBER has drawn dozens of new entrants into the market since 2016. The website <a href='http://evtol.news/'>evtol.news</a> keeps a running tab of eVTOL projects and start-ups&#8202;-&#8202;there are 167 of them listed as of May 14 2019, and many innovative designs are emerging.</p> <h3>Big Questions remain</h3> <p>Above all, it's about the performance of batteries. If it took engineers over one hundred years to progress from 30 Wh/kg to 160 Wh/kg, how long is it going to take to make the next leap? Aviation fuel (Jet-A) has an energy density of 11,000 Wh/kg!</p> <p>The answer is that such a leap might not be necessary. Electric motors are inherently more efficient than thermal engines, by as much as a factor of 2. Moreover, electric propulsion scales linearly, enabling distributed propulsion. Distributed propulsion allows better airframe designs with superior lift/drag ratios than conventionally designed aircraft.</p> <p>Hybrid designs, especially where a generator is used to power distributed electric motors, can allow aircraft to benefit from some of the advantages of distributed propulsion, and obtain longer ranges or higher payloads without having to wait for battery technology to improve. <a href='https://zunum.aero/'>Zunum</a> in the US and <a href='https://www.voltaero.aero/en/'>Voltaero</a> in France are taking this approach.</p> <p>But limitations in battery performance is unlikely to put much of a brake on this new sector for the simple reason that most flights are relatively short. Many routes (especially short helicopter hops, like Nice to Monaco) are well within the range of existing technology. Many more routes will soon be in range as improvements are beginning to be commercialized.</p> <p>UBER Elevate specification calls for 300Wh/kg for aircraft put into commercial service in 2023, and it has assured its aircraft partners that it is working with battery partners to ensure this can be achieved. With the current growth of the terrestrial EV market, there is no lack of focus on improving batteries. Additionally, new chemistries, such as solid-state lithium ( <a href='https://www.blue-solutions.com/en/'>Bollor&#233;</a>, <a href='https://www.saftbatteries.com/'>SAFT</a> and others), lithium metal ( <a href='http://www.pelliontech.com/'>Pellion Technologies</a> for example) and lithium sulphur ( <a href='https://oxisenergy.com/'>Oxis Energy</a>) are beginning to be commercialized. Oxis Energy recently announced a 450 Wh/kg cell, and funding for a factory to build them in Brazil. Even though battery technology remains in flux and certification challenges remain, it is unlikely that batteries will constrain the development of at least short-haul electric flight.</p> <h3>Other Forces at play</h3> <p>What's really driving electric aviation and the market for 'flying cars' and electric airplanes?</p> <p>1)<strong> Environmental concerns.</strong> The initial impetus for electric aviation came from the 'Green Flight Challenge.' Although the industry incumbents try to make light of it and claim that aviation accounts for merely 2% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most observers agree that it's one of the fastest growing sources of GHG. Many suspect that the 2% figure is a very significant under-estimate, especially if the warming effect of contrails are taken into account. The carbon footprint of commercial aviation has long been a pet-peeve of environmentalists and some have even vowed to stop flying completely, or at least severely limit it. A 'shame of flying' or <em>flygskam</em> has entered into the public consciousness in Sweden to the point that domestic air travel demand declined in 2018, with a commensurate increase in demand of intercity train travel. Governments are beginning to respond to these concerns; the Norwegian government has mandated all-electric domestic flights by 2040. Environmental concerns may also become a key driver for the deployment at scale of cargo and delivery drones.</p> <p>2) <strong>The flying car fantasy. </strong>No one likes getting stuck in traffic and if a similarly priced alternative is available, as promised by the likes of UBER, what is there not to like?</p> <p>3) The promise of <strong>'distributed aviation'</strong> and <strong>regional air taxi services</strong>. The mega-hub system is designed to serve the operational efficiency of airlines flying large fossil fueled aircraft. Many people (in mature developed economies) live within a few miles of a local airfield, and their final destination is within a few miles of a local airfield. Regional aviation has been constrained by high costs and noise. If both of these constraints are removed, a renaissance in regional aviation may ensue.</p> <p>4) <strong>Cargo drones </strong>are paving the way for eVTOLs. Easily accepted by society initially for the enhanced delivery of emergency medical services and transport of medical samples, it will be a small step to introduce air ambulances, especially if they are quieter and less costly than existing helicopters. Similar acceptability will be found for fire-fighting. As functional drones are normalized, last mile delivery is likely to become more acceptable, especially if lower carbon footprints can be demonstrated.</p> <h3>Turbulence</h3> <p>Let's assume that incremental improvement in batteries is sufficient to economically serve short urban/suburban and even regional routes.</p> <p>What could still prevent this market from emerging at scale anytime soon?</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Noise</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;all of the new market entrants are promising quieter aircraft, sometimes much more quiet than existing ones. If this benefit does not materialize, public acceptance for new airport facilities and increased usage of existing ones may prove to be very difficult.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Costs&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;as with noise, everyone is promising a big reduction in costs, especially in operating and maintenance costs. While it's clear that 'electric' fuel is usually less expensive than the hydrocarbon equivalent, it may not be the case in all refueling locations. Also, battery life for this new application remains uncertain, and they may need to be replaced more often than anticipated.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Infrastructure&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;many new infrastructure elements need to be put into place for this industry to emerge, including the obvious 'vertiports' for flying taxis, but also the electrical charging infrastructure. According to some estimates, even a modest recharging facility at an airport will require a doubling of existing electrical power availability. Existing air traffic management systems will need to be upgraded or supplemented to accommodate increase traffic, and traffic flying in new corridors. Who will pay for these infrastructure elements remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Certification&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;it goes without saying that safety is of paramount importance. Commercial air transport has an exemplary safety record, and it's highly unlikely that standards or passenger expectation will be lowered. Certification bodies face major challenges to evaluate and certify new technologies, and are likely, given recent events surrounding the 737MAX, to be overly cautious.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Pilots&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;a renaissance in regional aviation and the emergence of ultra-short-haul eVTOLs will require a significant increase in licensed pilots. Certification agencies also need to adapt licensing to accommodate the new technologies of eVTOLs and electric propulsion. Autonomous systems can overcome this constraint, if and when certification and regulatory authorities agree.</p> <p>Paradigm shift or not, the race is on to build and deploy these new electric aircraft. Long term success will depend on how well and how quickly market participants navigate through these areas of turbulence.</p> <p>For investors, deciding where to place bets is challenging. Let's first consider who makes money in aviation today; the most profitable links in the air transport industry value chain are the ticket sellers and the computer reservation systems. This throws an interesting light on UBER's positioning in the industry. Other attractive segments include all freight forwarders, navigation and other services provided to the airlines.</p> <p>To what degree this value chain holds in the transition to an electrified industry remains to be seen, and a big question hanging over the sector is: who is going to take the risk to purchase, finance, insure, and operate these new aircraft?</p> <h3>Attractive investment themes in electric aviation</h3> <p><a href='https://www.aster.com/'>Aster</a> has been investing in early and growth stage innovators driving industry transformations for the past 20 years. We've developed a number of investment themes in electric aviation and urban air mobility which leverage and complement our existing investing activity in mobility, energy and industry. Our main themes in aviation include:</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Ticket sales</strong> and computer reservation systems. There is already a brisk business in fractional ownership and reselling capacity on private aircraft, including helicopters.</p> <p>&#183; The <strong>supply chain</strong> of the new aircraft manufacturers&#8202;-&#8202;batteries, battery management systems, electrical control systems, motors; avionics, sensors, navigation aids, autonomous pilot systems. High fidelity design tools for electric propulsion.</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Infrastructure</strong> <strong>and services</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;including vertiports, warehouses for delivery drones, air traffic management systems, battery charging, maintenance.</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Cargo and delivery drones</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;buoyant existing market for equipment and services, fewer regulatory constraints.</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Aircraft manufacturers</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;rigorous assessment of management and technical teams required, as well as technical review of design concept and execution capability. Entry barriers seem deceptively low; many start-ups will hit the wall as they attempt to undergo certification of their aircraft.</p> <h3>Paradigm Shift?</h3> <p>We most probably are in the midst of a paradigm shift: the underlying assumptions about the air transport industry may no longer hold. Market entrants arriving with new technologies present both challenges and opportunities for the incumbents. Airport planners and civil aviation authorities need to consider that growth may also come from regional airports rather than just mega-hubs. Cities and regions need to consider the benefits and risks of introducing urban air mobility and cargo drones. For the old guard a paradigm shift represents both threats and opportunities: existing airlines may be surprised by how quickly new entrants begin to erode the edges of their already fragile businesses.</p> <strong>Whether you are an entrepreneur, a corporate or an investor, we invite you to discuss joining us in this new adventure.

Buying what? To use with whom?)</li> <li>Checking the locations of our loved ones and wondering why they aren't moving on the highway (has there been an accident?)</li> <li>Wondering if that random spike in heart rate while we were sleeping (thanks, Apple Watch) is a warning sign</li> <li>Googling. Everything.</li> <li>Tracking everything that can be tracked</li> <li>Someone isn't answering our texts. Are they okay? It's been, like, three hours.</li> <li>Checking emails before bed, when years ago we'd have to wait until we got back into the office to see if we had any memos</li> <li>Calling and texting our loved ones at work. Remember when we had to call their office, say there was an emergency, and ask their supervisor if they were available?</li> </ul> <h4><strong>Technology has fundamentally changed the way that we seek, receive, and process information.</strong></h4> <p>Our treadmills let us know that we haven't burned enough calories, so now we have to go for an extra 19 minutes or we'll have to skip lunch. 437 calories isn't enough. It has to be at least 500. We trust these metrics more than we trust how our clothes fit or how our bodies look.</p> <p>We have been conditioned to collect, track, and obsess over data regarding our personal health and wellness to the point that it's difficult to actually be well anymore.</p> <p>It even stretches into our religious practices, for those who practice, and contributes to our spiritual fears. Did we break our fast a minute too early by accident? Back in the day, the fast was broken at sunset&#8202;-&#8202;but now we can time the sunset with such precision that we assume God is judging us using the same strict metrics.</p> <p>We've become numb to disturbing web content. Graphic videos&#8202;-&#8202;including extremely triggering videos&#8202;-&#8202;go viral and show up on our news feeds on autoplay. No matter how sick we feel, we sometimes watch them more than once. We've have been conditioned to watch things that we don't even want to watch and wouldn't have sought out on our own. It's hard to be well when this happens again and again.</p> <p>On one hand, technology can open our eyes to the world around us&#8202;-&#8202;but on the other hand, I didn't need to see that video of a child bleeding out on the floor in order to believe that it happened. I didn't need to watch the first-person perspective video from the New Zealand mosque shooting in order to understand the severity of that situation. I didn't ask to receive this content, but I did. I used to make light of trigger warnings, but now I understand them.</p> <p>See how quickly this escalated?</p> <p>It's also the reason I've pretty much accepted that my anxiety cannot be cured. No amount of deep breathing, meditation, or trigger elimination can take it away.</p> <p>There is too much that we have the ability to know, to track, to find out, to think about.</p> <p>What we don't know can't hurt us. But now, we CAN know. We can watch our biggest fears unfold in real time.</p> <p>I know the knowledge is out there&#8202;-&#8202;and now I need it.</p> <p>I'm afraid to <em>not</em> know.</p> <p>I can turn off every device. I can cancel my internet. I can refuse to look when someone offers to show me a 'crazy video'. I can stop tracking any and all metrics regarding myself or my loved ones.</p> <strong>But I can't stop thinking about the fact that if something bad happens, I <em>could</em> have known&#8202;-&#8202;and through technology, I <em>could </em>have prevented it.</strong> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*9-NmT9I8nwJqsws5'> </figure> <h4>The fact that technology has the potential to wreak havoc with our mental health is one thing... but the fact that treatment options are becoming more conservative is another.</h4> <p>With advances in technology, researchers develop and test new medications and treatment options for those who suffer from anxiety, panic disorder, or related conditions. These treatments are designed to prevent dependence on benzodiazepines and to help patients 'stabilize' their moods so that they won't be 'too' anxious.</p> <p>Gone are the days of asking for a magic pill and receiving it. Now, if you demand medication, you'll have to try SSRIs first&#8202;-&#8202;even if you have no symptoms of depression. If you push hard enough, you might get to try glorified Benadryl (a.k.a. Hydroxyzine) before a benzodiazepine will even be considered.</p> <p>You'll have to prove that your mental health is really in shambles&#8202;-&#8202;and when you try, technological advances in medicine will be there to put you in your place and to remind you to meditate your troubles away. Even if your anxiety is a lifelong condition, <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505440/'>you won't have an easy time getting lifelong treatment</a>.</p> <h4>Meanwhile, on your walk to the doctor's office, you might pass by:</h4> <ul> <li>people filming other people's lowest moments and sharing the videos online</li> <li>TVs in public spaces tuned to footage of world news</li> <li>a bunch of clocks, reminding you that you're late</li> </ul> <p>And you might receive:</p> <ul> <li>6 work emails</li> <li>4 text messages asking where you are</li> <li>a voicemail that's time sensitive</li> <li>11 social media notifications</li> <li>a notification from 'Find My Friends' regarding the location of a loved one</li> <li>a reminder from your fitness app that you've eaten too much today</li> </ul> <p>and so on.</p> <p>I've accepted that I can't get away from technology, nor the anxiety that accompanies it. I acknowledge that technology has deeply affected my emotional well-being, but I need it. I recognize that no matter how much I push it away, it will come back.</p> <strong>Is this the new normal?</strong> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-tctf9EwRoVeWJ6xFsx4Hw.png'> </figure> </div>`
