    data: `<div> <h2>Is there a relationship between Music and Food?</h2> <strong>What kind of Food do you prefer?</strong> <p>All of us are Joey Tribbianis' at heart, whether we learn to control our impulses and manage our diets or have standard two pizzas every Friday, we all love food. However, if someone were to ask me what kind of food I prefer, I'd say it varies every day, depending on the mood. Somedays I'd go for proper Chinese food, while the others I would just order some bigger-than-my-mouth, good Ol' Burger, dripping in mozzarella.</p> <strong>What kind of Music do you prefer?</strong> <p>Whether it is rock, pop, jazz- we all have our preferences. For instance, during parties, I usually prefer loud, upbeat music that I could dance to, but when I am home all alone, I secretly like to listen to the old classics(Can't help falling in love by Elvis Presley- still my favorite!).</p> <h4>Music and Mood</h4> <p>Music holds the ability to change our mood within seconds. Listening to slow songs takes us down the memory lane, helps us reminisce, remember old friends, conversations and important moments from our life making us nostalgic. Meanwhile listening to a more upbeat song recharges us, helping some people focus while making the others want to dance.</p> <h4>Mood and Food</h4> <p>Stress-eating is a thing. The relationship between our mood and the type of food we eat is a much-discussed topic. Whether it is an important exam, or a difficult decision or even a breakup, we eat. From finishing buckets and buckets of ice cream to filling ourselves with all kinds of junk food, we binge on unhealthy food like anybody's business when we are stressed.</p> <h4>So the question is, How exactly does music affect your food choice?</h4> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1Yp3zJuxA8TvVFssLfj-Ew.jpeg'> </figure> <p>In a recent group of <a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-018-0583-8'>studies</a>, published in the Journal of Academy of Marketing Science, Dipayan Biswas investigated the 'Effects of ambient music and background noise on food sales'.</p> <p>With the multiplying chains of restaurants and new places opening every day, the competition in the Food industry is crazy. New restaurants are going to lengths to increase their sales and establish their name in the market. While the food remains the same more or less, these restaurants are enhancing their ambiance to attract customers.</p> <p>In this research, Biswas studied the effects of ambient music on the food choices customers make. But how does music set the 'ambiance'? It depends on the volume at which it is set and the genre of the music.</p> <h4>Volume:</h4> <p>It is a long used marketing strategy by numerous outlets, where they use the volume of the music to select the age group of potential customers. For example, what kind of music comes to your mind when you think of a chic cafe or a burger place filled with high schoolers? Nothing except loud, upbeat music- The newest hits.</p> <p>Whereas you'd see the opposite atmosphere if you go for a 'fine dine'. The music is definitely mellow and the customers are mostly adults.</p> <p>In one of the studies, a cafe was randomly chosen, located in a quiet neighborhood. Two days were selected to test out the hypothesis. On Wednesdays, only mellow, softer songs were played whereas on Fridays considerably louder music was played. At the end of the chosen time frame, it was found almost 43% of healthy food was ordered on Wednesdays(low volume) and while only 32.49% of healthy food was sold on Fridays(High volume).</p> <h4>Genre:</h4> <p>In another study by Biswas, he chose a number of college students to test out the effect of different music genres on the food choices. To substitute as 'loud music' a series of heavy metal rock music was used and students were asked to choose from chocolate and granola bars. The results showed that during the heavy metal rock, only 52.57% chose granola bars as compared to 92% for the alternate.</p> <p>He explained the results by saying: 'The findings of our research suggest that relaxation that stems from low volume music leads to [an] increased preference for healthy foods.'</p> <strong>Loud Music and Stress-Eating:</strong> <p>Loud music/ background noise can be a lot sometimes. It can make you uncomfortable, it can stress you out and can seem to get on your nerves. This stress causes your body to crave all kinds of unhealthy foods. and that's how you start stress eating.</p> <p>'Not surprisingly, chronic dieters and restrained eaters are especially sensitive to the effects of stress. Excitement/stress lead individuals to choose unhealthy foods mainly because sweet and fatty foods help reduce high levels of excitement and stress. In fact, research with both humans and animals suggests that unhealthy/comfort foods can alleviate physiological stress responses.'</p> <strong>Slow Music and Relaxation:</strong> <p>The opposite effect is shown by playing slow, meditative music, as shown in a <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/'>study</a>, by L. Bernardi and co-authors where they carried out measured the cardiovascular and respiratory changes in a patient as he listened to music.</p> <p>They concluded their research by explaining the effects of music.</p> <p>' Music induces an arousal effect, predominantly related to the tempo. Slow or meditative music can induce a relaxing effect; relaxation is particularly evident during a pause. Music, especially in trained subjects, may first concentrate attention during faster rhythms, then induce relaxation during pauses or slower rhythms.'</p> <p>Hence the more relaxed you are, the better choices you make.</p> <h4>Reference:</h4> <ol> <li> <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11747'>Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</a>. <a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-018-0583-8?fbclid=IwAR3suNxaXhXemzaT9txQaTxOaU7eTDjvkxAG_ampBy5i5fa0xLa-BZqbF4g'>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-018-0583-8?fbclid=IwAR3suNxaXhXemzaT9txQaTxOaU7eTDjvkxAG_ampBy5i5fa0xLa-BZqbF4g</a> </li> <li> <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/'>Heart</a>. 2006 Apr; 92(4): 445-452. <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846</a> </li> </ol> </div>`

Followers of Whole30, paleo and <a href='https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/body/food/what-you-should-know-about-keto-diet'>keto diets</a> and clean eaters, too, rave about its health benefits, versatility and fat-burning superpowers.</p> <p>The idea that you can melt off pounds by eating high-fat foods has a way of capturing the public's imagination. The idea got a boost when a 2003 study <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2003.53'>found</a> that a group of men fed a diet containing medium-chain triglycerides&#8202;-&#8202;that coconut oil happens to have a lot of&#8202;-&#8202;saw their overall body fat decrease. The researchers thought that this might be because they appeared to burn fat at a higher rate.</p> <p>'But not so fast,' says <a href='https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/vanessa-imus'>Vanessa Imus</a>, a registered dietitian at the Weight Loss Management Center at University of Washington Medical Center-Roosevelt.</p> <h3>The fat that makes you thin</h3> <p>There are holes that can be punched into the eating-coconut-fat-can-make-you-thin premise. Participants in that 2003 study were fed medium-chain triglycerides&#8202;-&#8202;something found neither in nature nor on the grocery store shelf. (' <a href='https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/228994'>Medium-chain</a> ' refers to the number of carbon atoms that comprise the tail or 'chain' of the fatty acid.)</p> <p>And results of a related study with women showed some increase in fat burning and energy expenditure but <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/0802169'>no change in body composition</a>.</p> <p>'There are some studies that suggest coconut oil has a better metabolic effect and others that show no difference. The research is still split,' says Imus.</p> <p>There's a long history of supposed fat-burners like grapefruit or apple cider vinegar that didn't pan out in long-term studies; there are as of yet no such long-term studies on coconut oil.</p> <p>The jury may still be out, but that hasn't stopped bloggers from milking the coconut oil trend for all it's worth.</p> <h3>The eating habits that make you healthy</h3> <p>'People hear about something like this and go out and buy all these pills and supplements and they're adding to what is already in their diet instead of just replacing it,' says Imus.</p> <p>What she recommends instead is eating for the long haul. That means eating a balanced diet of unprocessed whole foods, including a variety of high-fiber vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds and lean proteins.</p> <p>'Coconut oil has high levels of calories and saturated fat and it's never a good idea to overdo those. You don't want to add more saturated fat to what is already in your diet,' says Imus.</p> <p>But she does have a few tips on how you can integrate coconut oil into your diet in a nutritionally sound way.</p> <p><strong>Replace some of your existing saturated fat consumption with coconut oil</strong>. Coconut oil is a good replacement for butter or shortening. Use it to grease your muffin pans, put on your toast or roast your vegetables.</p> <p><strong>Use coconut oil to cook at high heats</strong>. Coconut oil can add a nice flavor to a stir fry and holds up well in high heat cooking. It doesn't oxidize like a lot of other oils will at high temperatures.</p> <p><strong>Choose unrefined coconut oil, sometimes also called 'virgin' or 'pure.'</strong> Like it sounds, unrefined coconut oil has no additives and is extracted from fresh coconuts. So if you do decide to go coconut, go unrefined.</p> <p>But when it comes to trying to use coconut oil to lose weight, meet with your local dietitian for healthier, more sustainable ideas, says Imus.</p> <p>'Think of coconut oil like you would a butter,' says Imus. 'You're probably not going to eat a stick of butter every morning with the idea that it will help you burn fat.'</p> </div>`

        data: `<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9lWsIauNsyeChocpAVeRJA.jpeg'> </figure> <p>The modern history of beef jerky in America is surprisingly brief&#8202;-&#8202;although its origins are older than the country itself.</p> <p>The original technique for jerky migrated north from South America in the 16th century, around the same time the first cows did.</p> <p>It wasn't long until that technique, <em>Ch'arki</em>, was Anglicised and bastardized into <em>jerky</em>. But America's acceptance of the dried beef was far from emphatic.</p> <p>In fact, the wholesale aversion to preserved meat is what created the 19th centuries largest American industry and its greatest American hero in the form of cattle drives and cowboys.</p> <p>So when exactly did Americans convert to the now ubiquitous cult of beef jerky?</p> <h3>The jerky we know and love</h3> <p>The answer, surprisingly, is 1986.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*y5jws6mhtER6r7V0'> </figure> <p>Jack Link's, the company started by Wisconsin's John 'Jack' Link, is almost single handedly responsible for the existence of the billion dollar meat snack industry.</p> <p>Link slowly grew the company by attending trade shows and getting placements in convenience stores until their distribution eventually mirrored the map of America.</p> <p>The approached worked incredibly well. Today, aside from being ubiquitous, the company makes upwards of $300 million a year and command more than 50% of the meat snack market share.</p> <p>While Jack Link's still makes quadruple the amount of its nearest competitor, the fact that competitors exist <em>at all</em> is a relatively recent development in the industry.</p> <p>The company's first competitor, Krave, only showed up in 2010. And less than 5 years later it was acquired by Hershey (in their first non-chocolate purchase). Now, the industry is overrun by seemingly 'artisanal' brands that are actually backed by massive consumer packaged goods conglomerates (EPIC Provisions, a brand popular in health food stores like Whole Foods, is owned by General Mills).</p> <p>The jerky land grab is fuelled by the industry trend towards 'better for you' meat protein products. The rise of general health consciousness, coupled with protein-heavy diets like Keto and Paleo, has guaranteed the success of any brand promoting itself as healthier, more protein packed, or containing less sugar.</p> <p>And this trend has opened the door for one particular protein snack that has, until now, been waiting patiently in the wings for its chance to penetrate the American market.</p> <h3>Still beef. Not jerky.</h3> <p>If you walk in to any specialty health food store today, you'll be hard pressed to find the kind of beef jerky that Jack Link's, EPIC, and others have had so much success peddling. In fact, in many cases, you'd be hard pressed to find beef jerky at all.</p> <p>The shelves are dominated by something new. Something called Biltong.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Kim-atfYPqyr5ffxB2RaEg.jpeg'> </figure> <p>To call biltong <em>new</em> is a misnomer. Biltong, in its current form, has existed since at least 1835, but its only now beginning to make the migration across the Atlantic.</p> <p>Biltong is a traditional South African food that comes from the <em>Afrikaans</em> words bil (meaning buttock) and tong (meaning strip). It's made with little more than salt and pepper, and is hung to air dry instead of being cooked at low temperatures like jerky is.</p> <p>Until very recently, Biltong has struggled to break into the North American market. Not because of how similar it is to jerky, but because of how different it is.</p> <h3>Tasting the difference</h3> <p>Like anything else that originates from outside America, biltong has had an existential crisis of sorts trying to market itself in America: do you try educate Americans on why biltong is better? Or do you just market yourself as another kind of jerky?</p> <p>The dilemma is hard to imagine for those who haven't tasted it.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*UAO9D3Ye0IYUi83LixEavg.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Biltong has been described in many ways, but the most accurate are probably 'like a cross between beef jerky and prosciutto' and 'like thin slices of steak'. Because of the way that it's prepared, biltong has a striking resemblance in taste to meat you would consume in your every day life. It tastes, more or less, like a rare steak.</p> <p>Wouldn't Americans rather eat portable steak than sugar-coated-meat-candy?</p> <p>That's the question American biltong makers have been losing sleep over for the last decade or so. Biltong's growth has actually been stunted by its comparisons to beef jerky. Because 'beef jerky without sugar' has been an awfully unappetizing (and inaccurate) description until the advent of the millennial health re-awakening.</p> <p>Like comparing miso and minestrone. Only using beef jerky as the most common ground between the two&#8202;-&#8202;a necessity because American culture is dominated by fast food rather than easy accessible, high quality, snack-able food.</p> <h3>The future of beef</h3> <p>As the market trends towards better, fewer, ingredients biltong has found a natural niche that jerky can't compete with. As consumers become more discerning, the chasm between 'less-sugar' jerky and zero sugar biltong will only widen.</p> <p>The jerky industry has spent so long prioritizing accessibility over quality and health that they are likely going to have a hard time scrambling to pivot from an industry built on selling to ' <a href='https://www.nosh.com/news/2018/beyond-bubba-better-jerky-changing-convenience'>bubba</a> ' to one that caters to the evolving desires of millennials, parents, and women.</p> <p>While biltong may never reach critical mass in America, it does seem destined to make a dent in the meat market&#8202;-&#8202;a fitting reward for being uncompromising in a market that was slow to accept them.</p> <p>In fact, making a dent is something South Africans are actively betting on. Last year <a href='https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stryve-biltong-protein-snacks-secures-10-million-investment-to-accelerate-manufacturing-capacity-and-brand-growth-300711865.html'>South African VCs raised R140 million</a> (~14 million dollars) on the premise that Americans would enjoy biltong more than beef jerky.</p> <p>I know which side my money's on.</p> </div>`

        data: `<div> <p>I've been with my partner my entire adult life. Cooking gives me a way to express myself. </p> <p>I remember the first time I cooked a meal on my own.</p> <p>I was in my third year of university, twenty years old, in a flat shared with a few other people. I'd made sure they were all away while I covertly Skyped my boyfriend who was teaching me to make that student essential: Spaghetti Bolognese.</p> <p>'So you've got your mince browning, and your pasta is boiling&#8202;-&#8202;do you have your chopped tomatoes ready?' he asked, trying to peer into the kitchen via my iPad, propped up on the microwave. I flapped a hand at the camera nervously while I focused on dicing my onions.</p> <p>Step by step, he coached me through my first-ever meal. I sauteed, I fried, I chopped, and I stirred. Finally, I sat down at the end, sweaty-handed and heart still rocketing, to my triumphant meal for one.</p> <p>'And the great thing is,' said my partner, now resting against some cans of beans across the table from me, eating his own meal two hundred miles away, 'is that you'll have leftovers for lunch tomorrow and maybe even dinner, too.'</p> <h3>My partner always cooked.</h3> <p>We got together my first year of college. He was in his third year. He was a great and enthusiastic cook, so he always invited me over for dinners he'd made, or he'd offer to cook at my apartment.</p> <p>(Obviously, I'd always clean up after.)</p> <p>But he did the vast bulk of the cooking. For my first and second year of college, it was rare that I had a meal not prepared by him. On the odd nights when he was busy, I'd eat in the college cafeteria, or eat out, or heat up a pizza. The year he moved away to start his PhD while I finished college, I actually lost weight because I'd often just have a can of tuna or some boiled eggs for dinner.</p> <p>My entire adult life up until that point, I'd been with someone a little older, a little wiser, and a lot better at cooking. The sudden absence of all that took its toll.</p> <p>When I finally asked him if he'd teach me to cook, he was happy to. I could have cracked open a cookbook, I could have looked at one of the many recipes online, but it was a nice way to stay connected with him while avoiding the scary world of unassisted cooking. It's hard for me to remember now, but there was a time when I was terrified of the prospect of cooking a spag bol from scratch.</p> <p>Through him, I learned how to make spag bol, fajitas, pasta carbonara, palak aloo, and bean burgers. I was sad, struggling through long-distance, but cooking was my lifeline. And as I grew braver in the kitchen, and started relying less on his tutelage, and branching out in experimental cooking, I learned that it's actually wonderful&#8202;-&#8202;surprisingly&#8202;-&#8202;to be able to feed yourself.</p> <p>We finally moved in together a year later, and I was happy to contribute to the cooking. I enjoyed looking up new recipes, trying new ingredients, and surprising him with interesting concoctions based on whatever we had left over in the fridge.</p> <p>Cooking meant I didn't have to rely on him to feed myself&#8202;-&#8202;and although it was nice to have that initial reason to stay in contact, it was much nicer to have it as a shared interest and hobby. While I missed him terribly when we tried to make our relationship last long-distance, cooking for myself meant I was doing just fine. It gave me my independence.</p> <p>There's something incredibly satisfying in choosing your meal, selecting the ingredients, preparing them all just so, and watching as out of individual components comes a whole meal greater than the sum of its parts. Just for yourself.</p> <h3>Cooking for two gave me a reason. Cooking for one? It gave me an excuse.</h3> <p>I've learned that an odd thing happens when you spend the vast bulk of your time with one person: you start to depend on them. All your life's patterns, your daily routines, they all revolve in ways both small and large around that other person.</p> <p>My partner and I lived together long enough that we fell into these codependent habits. We grew used to leaning on one another. We forbade screens from our dinner table and focused only on each other.</p> <p>When we were together, we were fine, happy, fulfilled, chasing other passions. We had separate interests, of course, but the vast bulk of our lives were shared. We woke up together, walked to work together, cooked and ate dinner together.</p> <p>However, when he went away for any period of time, I struggled. Even when he was just out for the night, I was much less likely to keep the house clean. I often stayed up too late browsing Twitter, missing the cue to go to bed. I didn't care to exercise as much.</p> <p>And I reverted back to my bad dinner habit.</p> <p>There was no motivation for me to cook anything, and it was just easier to be lazy and eat a pizza. I'd cook it, eat it joylessly while watching Netflix and feel like garbage for not making an effort with the meal. I'd either binge on junk food or forget to eat altogether. Alone, I didn't take care of myself.</p> <p>Here's the kicker: there's no reason for me to be like this. I've got plenty of free time, a grocery store a five-minute walk away, and the knowledge and finances to cook myself whatever I damn well please. There are no excuses&#8202;-&#8202;when my partner is away, I simply don't feel it's worth it.</p> <p>When I cooked for two people, it gave me a reason: a reason to experiment, a reason to explore different flavors and styles, a reason to really get into the cuisine. When it was just me? It gave me <em>an excuse</em> to drop all my good new cooking habits and default to the easiest thing to do.</p> <p>It sounds ridiculous writing it down, that I was so dependent on my partner's presence that without him I couldn't be bothered to look after my health properly. But it was true. I slept worse, I exercised worse, and I ate worse.</p> <h3>I've made a pact with myself.</h3> <p>Things came to a head when my partner was out of town for a week. Morosely, I took myself to the store and bought five frozen pizzas. I was eating the first one, alone at the kitchen table, watching <em>Buffy</em>, as I watched my cats munching down with gusto the dinner I'd prepared for them.</p> <p>It occurred to me that I'd put more effort into their dinner than mine.</p> <p>I've always been a huge proponent of independence within relationships: I have a FOF (f*ck-off fund) in case things ever go south and I need to be financially secure on my own for a few months. I firmly believe in the importance of individual hobbies and interests. I encourage the both of us to cultivate diverse friendship circles.</p> <p>But for some reason, I didn't think I was worth cooking for. For myself and my partner, I'd cook elaborate soups, exciting slow-cooker recipes. For myself? I was worth only a single, cooked-from-frozen pizza. And that wasn't right.</p> <p>So I decided that every time he was away, even if just for one evening, I'd never stoop to a frozen pizza, or a microwave meal, or take-away. I meal-plan. I prep. I use the ingredients we have in the fridge or I buy new ones. And I cook myself an actual meal.</p> <h3>I'm worth a gourmet meal.</h3> <p>Having spent nearly the entirety of my adult life in a relationship with a single person has shaped me. It's had to&#8202;-&#8202;such sustained relationships affect us all, whether we like it or not, in ways we like and ways we don't.</p> <p>And I found I was far more reliant on my partner than I wanted to be. I wish I didn't get mopey when he wasn't around. I wish it didn't affect my sleeping patterns to fall asleep on my own. But I do, and it does.</p> <p>It's not necessarily a bad thing. We're happy together, and we lead independent lives, but when we're so entwined that I can't fathom the thought of cooking just for myself, I can recognize it's time to change something.</p> <p>For me, learning to cook was a way of learning to value myself, my health. It was a way first of proving that I didn't need to be cooked for, that I was my own adult, and then that I valued myself enough to cook healthy, filling, robust meals&#8202;-&#8202;just for myself.</p> <p>And honestly? Sometimes I still mess up. Sometimes I'm so down and sad and feeling lonesome that I can't help but order pizza, or boil the single egg in the pantry. Sometimes the cats still eat better than I do.</p> <p>But I'm getting better. At cooking, at looking after myself, at finding the independence in what's likely to be the longest relationship of my life. And I'll keep on improving.</p> </div>`

Mango hell to be unleashed like never before in the 10 years we've lived in our home.</p> <p>I saw it coming. The cool days were dwindling. Little flowers sprouting everywhere. An unstoppable dreaded yield's beginning.</p> <strong>Memories of the mango trauma I endured are flooding back&#8202;-&#8202;the mysterious living nightmare.</strong> <p>Working two jobs coupled with family life kept me so busy I barely had time to do anything except sleep and pay bills between my obligations.</p> <p>I earned an afternoon off from my job at Costco and just finished taking care of an account running my lawn business. Being sweaty and dirty, the time seemed perfect to pick mangoes.</p> <p>Hundreds of the green fruit dangle precariously on weak taunting stems mocking me. Fallen mangoes must be avoided.</p> <p>Rats and squirrels nip at the fruit. They leave fleshy remanents rotting on the ground. Wasps build homes in the wasting mangoes.</p> <p>Grabbing low hanging mangoes and bagging them I am stung several times by wasps guarding their territory. The stings are annoying but I keep picking. I also made it a point to dispose of the grounded decomposing fruit.</p> <p>The taste of mangoes repulses me but my neighbors and relatives love them. Mango smell is all over me. Juice seeps from the fruit as I break each mango off the tree. It's sticky and emanating a sweet pungent odor.</p> <strong>Ripe mango scent invades my mouth and I tasted the tropical yuch!</strong> <p>My hands were sticky. I acquired 7 wonderful wasp stings and mosquitoes bit my arms, legs, and neck. After collecting a 100 mangoes my fruit picking afternoon came to a conclusion.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*24sl3qy5n5g8syMdwBFiBg.jpeg'> </figure> <h3>A rough day's rough night.</h3> <p>The insect bites were itching and I tried to resist but I scratched them. Debris from the mango tree fell into my eyes so I used my mango juice covered hands to rub and clear the irritations.</p> <p>Waiting too long to use the bathroom caused me to rush inside and I didn't wash my hands before relieving myself. I vigorously cleaned up and took a shower.</p> <p>As the evening went on I noticed unusual flares of itching all over my body. Infernal, persistent bother. Fortunately, we had Benadryl. I swallowed the medicine and the itching subsided. I fell asleep.</p> <p>But, sleep soon evaded me. Constant agitation awakened me throughout the night. I tried not to scratch and rubbed any irritations. My body blossomed in patches of stinging red blotches.</p> <p>Exhaustion got the best of me and though the itches kept up their assault sleep passed over me for about an hour then the morning arrived. Opening my eyes became a struggle. Sticky goo glued my lids and lashes shut.</p> <p>Rubbing my closed eyes with my palms loosened the gook keeping them shut. But, my vision was obscured and cloudy. The skin around my eye sockets felt puffy and a horrible itching attacked my groin area.</p> <p>The bathroom mirror revealed the horror. My eyes were swollen. Red dotted splotches populated areas all over my body. My groin was on fire and my breathing was irregular.</p> <p>Driving to the doctor required all of my concentration. At least didn't have to go into work at Costco. I had Friday off but my lawn accounts required servicing. Luckily my doctor squeezed me in for an early appointment due to another patient's cancellation.</p> <p>(Maintaining my lawn service accounts, later on, required all my fortitude in getting through the hot, sticky, itchy hell.)</p> <p>Explaining to the doctor about picking the mangos and being stung by wasps several times gave him some concern. He gave me a prescription for a strong dose of the medicine in Benedryl then explained how though I had not been allergic to wasps in the past due to my aging my body was changing.</p> <p>I assumed my doctor was correct and took the medicine. My swelling and itching went away after a few days.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5vRAd_RO_ZWo3vvXICNCmg.png'> </figure> <h3>Surprising repeat.</h3> <p>Weeks passed and more mangos became ripe for the picking. The accumulation needed collection. I sprayed the mango tree area with tons of vinegar and lemon juice 2 or 3 times since the last mango gathering episode and the wasps were gone.</p> <p>Filling used plastic grocery bags full of mangos for family and neighbors gave me a sense of usefulness. My reward enjoyed by happy thank yous. Though I couldn't stand the mango taste everyone else seemed to love them.</p> <p>Mango tree sap covered my fingers and hands again. I didn't think much about the sticky juice.</p> <p>The next morning I awakened to eyes glued shut. My body itched all over. But, I hadn't been stung by wasps. What the hell was going on?</p> <p>Then the notion struck me. Maybe I was allergic to mangos. The idea seemed odd. I never heard of a mango allergy.</p> <p>Rushing to my computer I wondered if my doctor ever considered or knew of mango sensitivity.</p> <p>I have eaten fresh mango, drank mango juice, and eaten desserts made with mango but never had an allergic reaction to such foods. So, why would I have a problem with picking mangos?</p> <p>Shazam! <a href='https://curiosity.com/topics/urushiol-what-poison-ivy-and-mangos-have-in-common-curiosity/'>A Google search revealed the relation of the mango tree to poison sumac, poison ivy, and poison oak. </a>Hidden in the branches, leaves, stems, and berries of the Mango, the chemical <strong>urushiol </strong>can cause swelling, blistering, and itching.</p> <h3>Bingo!</h3> <p>My new prognosis fit the circumstances. I found topical diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and applied the cream to itchy outbreaks covering my body. I also drank portions of the medicine until my allergic breakouts concluded.</p> <p>I have been stung by wasps a few times since the first mango picking craziness. No allergic reaction. The stings are just an annoyance.</p> <p>But, mango trees are dangerous to me. My mango tree yells danger at me.</p> <p>Now, when I pick mangos I go in fully covered. My outfit consists of pants, a long sleeved shirt, an old, large, well-used windbreaker (with a high neck), a hat, protective side-paneled glasses, boots, and plastic gloves.</p> <strong>Absolutely no skin exposure!</strong> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wRnVXmh52d4YiI8T5Yf5zw.jpeg'> </figure> <p>I don't care if it's close to 100&#730; Fahrenheit and I'm covered in a lake of perspiration while picking mangos. I'm staying safe.</p> <p>Please be careful when picking mangos. Small efforts in planning to dress appropriately when collecting mangos can prevent unexpected itching and swelling hell.</p> <p>Then, go for it and pick away. <a href='https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/mango-recipes'>Enjoy your mangos in many ways.</a></p> <strong>The reward is great.

You may not have heard too much about it but according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO), urban agriculture is something that is practised by <a href='http://www.fao.org/urban-agriculture/en/'>800 million people worldwide</a>, over one-tenth of the global population. So what exactly is it and how is it changing how we produce and distribute food?</p> <strong>What is urban farming?</strong> <p>Urban farming, or urban agriculture, can be described as the growing of plants and raising of animals in and around towns, cities and urban environments. Until recently, farming has been a largely rural activity. But the development of technology, together with a pressing need to find more sustainable ways of production and consumption, has led to the adaptation of farming techniques in more built up environments.</p> <p>There are several different types of urban farms of varying scales that exist in different parts of the world, including commercial city farms, community gardens, community orchards, indoor vertical farms, hydroponic greenhouses, rooftop gardens, urban aquaponic farms (or fish farms), urban beehives and small-scale homestead farms. They produce a range of goods for local consumption or retail, such as grains, vegetables, fruit, meat, poultry, fish, herbs, honey and dairy products.</p> <p>Urban farms can be small, medium or large-scale commercial enterprises, cooperatives run by community groups or residents, or even individual set ups. The farms have proliferated in both developed and developing countries in recent years, serving slightly different purposes in general in each. Farms in wealthier industrialised nations have largely been in response to the challenge to find more sustainable methods of agricultural production, along with moves towards more localized economies. In poorer countries, they have come about through multi-stakeholder efforts to combat food insecurity and hunger levels.</p> <strong>Why has urban farming become popular?</strong> <p>Urban farming has grown in popularity over the last 10-15 years. In the developing world, it has largely been driven by the rapid urbanization of developing regions. The urban population across the developing world has grown by around 500 million in the last decade and it is predicted that, by 2025, <a href='http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/whyuph/index.html'>more than half of the developing world</a> will live in urban areas. The main drivers of urban growth in these countries are high birth rates and an influx of rural people trying to escape poverty. Unlike countries where urbanization has been driven by industrialization, in low income areas it is often accompanied by high levels of poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. Urban farming has been seen as a way to combat all three of these problems.</p> <p>In richer nations, the growth of urban agriculture has been in tandem with a return to localism, the growth of localized businesses, social entrepreneurialism and ethically-minded start ups. Social good and environmental sustainability are high on the agenda with new businesses, with one study finding that <a href='https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_next_phase_of_business_sustainability'>90% of today's CEOs and 88% of business students</a> believe that sustainability is an important part of commercial success. Finding new and improved agricultural methods is an important area of sustainability. <a href='https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/agriculture-and-food-systems-unsustainable'>Studies have found</a> that agriculture uses 38% of the world's land area and is responsible for over 70% of global freshwater consumption. With more people concentrated in urban areas, farms can be more productive without using up the same level of resources. Warmer urban conditions are also conducive to the growing of crops.</p> <p>Not all urban farming practices, however, are for a commercial profit. There are many such as community gardens and community orchards that are run by charities, community groups or resident cooperatives and exist for more social purposes such as sharing food, providing for poorer sections of the community, or bringing parts of the community together.</p> <strong>What are the impacts of urban farming?</strong> <p>Impact on businesses and the economy</p> <p>Urban farming can have many positive effects on the local economy. As well as presenting green-fingered entrepreneurs with opportunities to start new local businesses, it also creates job opportunities for local people. Furthermore, farms can often provide local shops, supermarkets and restaurants with cheaper and fresher produce which has knock-on positive effects.<a href='https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/02/big-data-suggests-big-potential-for-urban-farming/552770/'> One study has estimated</a> that urban farms have the potential to provide around 10% of global vegetable crops, which could translate into big savings for local economies worldwide. Start up costs, however, are still high. Those involved in urban farming typically work longer than average hours, lose more food than rural farmers due to urban pests, and struggle to find skilled and experienced staff.</p> <p>Impact on the environment</p> <p>Urban farming has been championed as a way of improving agricultural environmental sustainability, but in truth it can have both positive and negative effects and it comes down to the way that farms operate and are regulated. Farms can provide a more efficient way of meeting local demand. If operated sustainably, they can reduce both the agricultural energy footprint (through eliminating the need to store and transport imported products) and the water footprint (through sustainable irrigation and water recycling). They can also transform wasteland into productive green space and stop it from becoming polluted. Vertical farms, which are set up inside multi-storey buildings and warehouses, also have the benefit of saving on space.</p> <p>But studies have shown that urban farms can also increase energy and water use. Indoor farms, such as vertical farms, use energy-intensive artificial lighting and climate control systems. Many farms <a href='https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/urban-farms-could-be-incredibly-efficient-but-arent-yet/'>use the municipal water supply</a> rather than a recycled water system for irrigation. There are also distinct health and safety risks with urban farming. Urban land can be contaminated with pollutants, while wastewater if not treated properly can contain human pathogens. This can compromise food safety if strict regulations are not in place.</p> <p>Impact on communities</p> <p>There are a number of positive social impacts associated with urban farming, such as:</p> <ul> <li>improving food security and reducing poverty among the poorest by providing cheaper and more easily available food;</li> <li>health benefits of providing affordable nutritious fruit, vegetables and organically produced meat;</li> <li>greater social inclusion by providing local job opportunities and, in the case of community projects, bringing communities together;</li> <li>educational opportunities for children, e.g. school trips to city farms and community gardens where pupils can learn more about where food comes from</li> </ul> <p>However, urban farming has <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/15/urban-farming-rich-hipsters-food-affordability-inequality'>attracted some criticism</a> in places such as Europe for becoming monopolized by the middle-classes and excluding lower income groups.</p> <strong>Who are the main players in urban farming?</strong> <p>Europe</p> <p>Urban farming in Europe is not a new phenomenon. In fact, several countries encouraged the production of food in urban environments during both the First and Second World Wars in the 20th century. Today, start up urban agriculture enterprises are cropping up across the continent. At governmental level, individual governments have had limited involvement but the EU-funded <a href='http://www.urban-agriculture-europe.org/'>Urban Agriculture Europe</a>, a network of over 120 researchers, have been looking into ways in which urban farming can play a key role in future EU agricultural policy. Berlin-based start up <a href='https://infarm.com/'>InFarm</a> has become the European urban farming leader with over 100 indoor and outdoor city farms in Germany, France and Switzerland. Among the largest urban farms in Europe are <a href='http://www.spaceandmatter.nl/urbanfarmers'>Space&amp;Matter</a> in the Netherlands, the <a href='https://www.jonesfoodcompany.co.uk/'>Jones Food Company</a> vertical farm in the UK, and the <a href='http://bigh.farm/'>BIGH</a> rooftop farm in Belgium.</p> <p>America</p> <p>There has been a growth in urban farming across the American continent in recent decades. In the US, policies and initiatives vary between states but projects ranging from vertical hydroponic enterprises to community gardens flourish across the country. A 2012 study by the <a href='https://www.usda.gov/'>United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) identified over 300 urban farms in the US. This includes<a href='http://www.gothamgreens.com/our-farms/pullman'> one of the world's largest urban farms</a> located across nearly two acres in Chicago. In Canada, there has been more state-level involvement. Toronto in particular has been proactive, setting up a Food Policy Council which has drawn up a <a href='http://tfpc.to/news/growto-action-plan'>GrowTO Urban</a> Agriculture Action Plan. In south and central America, where poverty and food insecurity are big issues in several countries, the UNFAO has been involved in kick-starting <a href='http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/projects/index.html'>urban micro-gardens projects</a> in countries including Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela.</p> <p>Asia</p> <p>Several Asian countries have invested significant amounts in urban farming technologies as a way of dealing with population growth and combating food insecurity. China, which has industrialized at a rapid pace in recent decades, has become a <a href='https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/chinas-indoor-farming-research-feed-cities-leads-world/409606/'>world leader in indoor vertical farming</a> thanks to state investment. Similarly, Thailand has a community-supported agriculture initiative, led by the <a href='http://www.tei.or.th/th/index.php'>Thailand Environment Institute</a>, that has helped create rooftop farms and indoor vertical farms across Bangkok. In India, another country that has urbanized at a pace, urban farming is now being seen as a sustainable food production method. Methods such as <a href='https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/rooftop-revolution-50161'>rooftop farming</a> have taken off in cities such as Kerala.</p> <p>Africa</p> <p>The African continent has also seen wide-scale urbanization in recent years. Urban farming methods in the poorest countries have largely centred around setting up micro-gardening and community gardening projects, overseen by <a href='http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/projects/index.html'>UNFAO</a>, equipping urban locals with skills and resources to produce sustainable and feed the local community. Methods such as vertical farming are starting to take hold in some African countries. Johannesburg has hosted two Urban Agri Africa Summits to date, looking into possibilities of developing urban farming technologies across the continent.</p> <p>Urban farming is unlikely to replace traditional agriculture any time soon but it will have a vital role to play in addressing challenges such as environmental sustainability and food insecurity in the coming years. As the world continues to urbanize and new technologies emerge, we can expect to see increasing governmental and inter-governmental involvement as urban farming becomes more mainstream. The key stakeholders will need to make sure that business models stay alert to environmental, social and economic challenges so that the farming of the future is a sustainable benefit for all.</p> </div>`
