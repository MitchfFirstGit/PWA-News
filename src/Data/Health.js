    data: `<div> <h4>Opinions on a Sleep Study</h4> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0*7-yKegHyFgjqqdjb'> </figure> <h2>Why we should embrace night owls for more productive and innovative work.</h2> <p>Last year a sleep <a href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2018.1454458'>study</a> found an increased risk of mortality among night owls, those people who prefer to stay up late. This was the first study to show a mortality correlation. Other studies have shown increased chronic disease in individuals who prefer the midnight hours.</p> <p>But the conclusions drawn from this study may not be the correct interpretations. In fact, the author, Dr. Kristen Knutson, has suggested that there are many more factors that contribute to the findings other than simply sleep and that we should be careful making generic assumptions regarding the meaning of the findings.</p> <p>Too many research articles present findings that end up being misconstrued, taking the results literally rather than looking at other explanations.</p> <blockquote>While the objective findings represent increased death in individuals who like to stay up late, this does not mean that night owls should necessarily go to bed earlier.</blockquote> <p>In fact, there are a whole host of possible changes in our culture that could be beneficial for individuals and the companies for which they work.</p> <p>Thus, the conclusions drawn should be multifactorial and explore the many factors that could improve life for night owls. This could result in successes for employers as well.</p> <p>Imagine a world where night owls do their work into the late hours and then sleep in before going back to work. Yea, revolutionary, right? A bimodal work schedule, allowing flexibility for employees that like staying up late and, just perhaps, might be a time of increased productivity for those employees.</p> <p>Think about it&#8202;-&#8202;work from 11am-5pm, then go home, relax, and start working again around 10pm-1am. You get the same amount of hours in each day, but on your own flexible schedule, with a nice break in between.</p> <p>I'm not spitting out all opinion. When you look at other studies, there are some interesting findings.</p> <p><strong>#1</strong> Night owls may be more intelligent and creative than morning larks.</p> <p><strong>#2</strong> Adults who picked their own work schedule had increased productivity and job satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>#3</strong> Health could be related to how long you sleep rather than when you sleep.</p> <h4>Intelligence and Creativity</h4> <p>I'd hate to think that people who are night owls tend to have more brains than early risers. That's discrimination, right? However, one <a href='https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/12/eaau6200'>study</a> claimed improved grades for kids who were able to sleep in. Another <a href='http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/paid2009.pdf'>study</a> looked at adolescents with a later sleep schedule and found them to be more intelligent and creative than others who went to bed early.</p> <p>Let's not get ahead of ourselves. These studies were not the highest quality and allow for a significant number of confounding factors. But they provide an interesting perspective that should not be ignored.</p> <p>I am a night owl so I'd love to think I am more intelligent and creative than my counterparts. Unfortunately, logic tells me this is not the case. There has to be another reason why these studies showed a difference.</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, our society's norms do not allow the flexibility to stretch our creative minds. If we could dictate our own work schedules, would that change these findings?</p> <p>What may be most important is to figure out the ideal circumstances for each individual that will allow them to be the most focused and productive.</p> <p>If we tailor work time to worker, perhaps more creativity and innovation will follow. I'm certainly at the best of my ability when I'm not tired. I'd love to see what would happen if everyone worked at the top of their game.</p> <h4>Increased Productivity</h4> <p>When you make the decision to work, rather than being forced to follow a schedule, it would make sense that you'd be more productive and more satisfied. One <a href='https://www.gensler.com/research-insight/gensler-research-institute/the-2013-us-workplace-survey-1'>survey</a> found this to be true. Not only are employees satisfied with their own work, but they were also happier with their employers.</p> <p>I understand that there are necessary meetings or teamwork activities in every job. Why do these need to be in the beginning of the day? If an employee needs to be in the office, then time it for midday when there would be overlap between morning risers and night owls.</p> <p>Furthermore, work is not about quantity, but quality.</p> <blockquote>If you want to measure how well an employee is working, measure their productivity and innovation.</blockquote> <p>I'd bet that night owls have a number of great ideas and could increase efficiency around midnight, so why not let them work these hours if the output is excellent?</p> <p>Rethinking work hours could be the best thing a company ever did for their production.</p> <h4>Improved Health</h4> <p>I'm aware that the original study cited showed increased mortality, but I'm not convinced that it is because night owls stay up late. In fact, isn't it possible that staying up late while required to wake up early for work could cause the health problems noted? This causes decreased sleep time and multiple <a href='http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/health'>studies</a> have shown that decreased sleep hours are associated with poor health.</p> <p>What if we did a study comparing people who go to bed early and wake up early to night owls that go to bed late and wake up late? And let's say that each of these groups gets the same amount of sleep hours.</p> <p>I can't claim to know the answer to this question. And we'd probably need to look at a longer term model to research this idea, as it would take a regular schedule over months or years to see health improvements from a change in sleep cycle. But I think it's worth considering.</p> <blockquote>If we can improve intelligence, creativity, productivity, and health with one solution by changing work hours, doesn't that seem like a win, win, win?</blockquote> </div>`

        data:`<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*G_Rzu5W1vmT-C7bVn5n31w.png'> </figure> <p>Nearly <a href='https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/05/01/more-than-100-million-americans-have-high-blood-pressure-aha-says'>half of all American adults</a> have high blood pressure (also known as hypertension), a chronic condition that puts strain on the heart, arteries, kidneys and brain and can lead to many serious threats to health, including heart disease and stroke&#8202;-&#8202;as well as the chance of having an untimely death. The good news is that in many cases, with careful management and lifestyle modifications, high blood pressure can be kept at healthier levels.</p> <p>May is <a href='https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/HBP-education-month'>National High Blood Pressure Education Month</a>, a good time to remember what causes high blood pressure, what the risks are, and how it can best be managed. When blood pressure is too high, the heart has to work harder than normal to get blood to all parts of the body, and there is also increased pressure on all of the blood vessels. Blood pressure readings that are regularly above <a href='https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/reading-the-new-blood-pressure-guidelines'>130/80</a> are considered high (stage 1 hypertension)&#8202;-&#8202;and unhealthy.</p> <p>Home care nurses at <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/how-we-can-help/private-care-services/'>Partners in Care</a>, where I work, and its affiliate, the <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/'>Visiting Nurse Service of New York</a>, often play a key role in making sure that patients and family caregivers understand and can manage their medical conditions, including high blood pressure, beyond the doctor's office. To manage hypertension, our nurse-led teams work with patients and caregivers to establish a plan of care at home, help them understand the risks and red flags, and make sure patients and their caregivers know the next steps to take should their condition worsen. Our Partners in Care home health aides are also trained to prepare healthy low-sodium meals that help lower high blood pressure.</p> <p>First, people need to make sure they have their blood pressure checked regularly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/features/undiagnosed-hypertension/index.htm'>13 million Americans</a> have hypertension but don't know it. The dangers of untreated hypertension are enormous: High blood pressure is implicated in almost half of all strokes (May is <a href='https://www.stroke.org/may-is-national-stroke-awareness-month/'>Stroke Awareness Month</a> as well), and is a leading factor contributing to a number of heart conditions.</p> <p>Some of the risk factors for high blood pressure are unavoidable. These include age&#8202;-&#8202;our blood vessels naturally stiffen over time&#8202;-&#8202;family history and genetics, gender, and ethnicity. High blood pressure is more common in African American adults than adults of other ethnicities, and statistics vary by gender. Before age 55, men are more likely than women to have high blood pressure. After 55, the situation is reversed, with women more likely than men to develop the condition.</p> <p>On the other hand, many of the risk factors for high blood pressure are tied to lifestyle&#8202;-&#8202;and this is where individuals who are at risk, along with the family members and friends who care for them, can make a great difference. Here are a few important things you can do to help reduce risk of hypertension in yourself or a loved one:</p> <strong>Say no to salt</strong> <p>As with most healthy diets, a nutrition plan for high blood pressure is rich in fruits and vegetables, low in saturated fats and&#8202;-&#8202;most especially&#8202;-&#8202;low in salt. Packaged foods such as canned soups and canned items in general are loaded with sodium, so be sure to read food labels to check the amount of sodium in packaged foods (in fact, you should avoid packaged foods completely whenever you can). Keeping a food journal is a simple way to hold yourself accountable to your healthy eating goals. Writing down the content on your food labels&#8202;-&#8202;such as salt or sugar content levels, or how many servings of fruits and vegetables you have each day&#8202;-&#8202;helps you see, manage and plan your diet more effectively.</p> <strong>Get yourself moving</strong> <p>Exercising is important in controlling blood pressure and preventing complications related to hypertension. In addition, getting regular exercise can help you reduce excessive body weight, which is another risk factor for high blood pressure. Just 15 to 30 minutes of light physical activity, three to five days a week, can help reduce your risk for stroke and heart disease. Once you get started, small steps can lead to big progress&#8202;-&#8202;so look for ways to build activity into your daily routine: If you live in the city, walk to the mailbox or the corner bodega every day, or get off one stop early and walk a few extra blocks if you ride the bus or subway. If you can't get outdoors, walk the halls of your apartment building. And if you live in the suburbs or out in a rural environment, try to walk rather than take the car when doing errands.</p> <strong>Mind your medications</strong> <p>If lifestyle changes don't adequately reduce your blood pressure, your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to improve your blood flow, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers. It is critically important to take the medication you are prescribed, how and when you are supposed to. It's been reported that nearly 3 out of 4 Americans do not always take their medication as directed. Let your doctor know if a medication disagrees with you&#8202;-&#8202;if you face side-effects such as dizziness or swelling&#8202;-&#8202;rather than just deciding to stop taking it. Also, you should always bring a list of all your medications to each doctor's appointment and have your physician update the list.</p> <strong>Stop (or at least reduce) smoking and drinking</strong> <p>Smoking raises blood pressure and can cause strokes&#8202;-&#8202;so try to cut back or, better still, stop smoking entirely. Limiting your alcohol consumption is important too, as alcohol can adversely affect some heart medications and is also linked to increased stroke risk. Each person is different, but moderation is crucial.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> The National Cancer Institute is one of many health organizations with a plan to <a href='https://smokefree.gov/'>help you quit smoking</a>.</p> <strong>Connect to care</strong> <p>It is especially important for those at high risk of hypertension to stay in communication with their physicians and to be aware of high blood pressure and related health risks. As always, it is important to consult your health provider before making significant changes in your diet or fitness routine.</p> <p>I still remember during Superstorm Sandy in late October/early November 2012, which stranded thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers, our corps of visiting nurses and other frontline caregivers racing around the city to visit homebound seniors who were unable to get their medicines. More often than not, these included hypertension medication&#8202;-&#8202;which isn't surprising, since about <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/high-blood-pressure-guide.pdf?pdf=high-blood-pressure-guide'>3 in 10 New Yorkers</a>, and <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/high-blood-pressure-guide.pdf?pdf=high-blood-pressure-guide'>62% of Americans age 65+&#8202;-&#8202;</a> have the condition.</p> <p>Fortunately, you can begin changing the equation today. Get your blood pressure checked regularly, and then follow up with these healthy steps towards better blood flow, and better health.</p> </div>`

        data: `<div> <p>At least we'll smell nice dead.</p> <blockquote>We are willing lab rats and anoint ourselves at the alter of big business alchemy.</blockquote> <p>Have you read the back of your antiperspirant? Are you concerned about the chemicals it contains or is ignorance bliss?</p> <p>Like most people, I'm conscious of what I eat and drink. I endeavor to ingest natural and healthy nutrition. I don't want to invite sickness, no body would. I like to keep my food chemical free.</p> <p>Why then do we persist in slathering questionable chemicals on our bodies to avoid body odor? Our skin is our biggest organ. It's porous and absorbs everything we put on it. It's a gateway to our internal functions.</p> <p>We've been conditioned to accept that even infinitesimal amounts of odor is publicly unacceptable. We trust multi-national manufacturers and rub their chemical concoctions on ourselves because no one wants to stink or be embarrassed by body odor. We are willing lab rats and anoint ourselves at the alter of big business alchemy.</p> <p>Why would we put any chemical on our bodies? Surely natural is better.</p> <p>It comes down to convenience and efficacy. Natural products often work less effectively, so we gamble on chemicals.</p> <p>I took an old antiperspirant of mine and looked at the contents. For years I sprayed this on my body. Here's some of the contents. (Some!)</p> <p>I'm not a scientist or researcher. This is purely my layman's interpretation on what is mass produced and sold to us on a world-wide scale. I make my own mind up.</p> <h3>1. Aluminium</h3> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ReT8SHIXC91VvRmwzC_DDg.jpeg'> </figure> <p>We're all exposed to aluminium. It could be through food or in vaccines. It's used in tin foil, soda cans and many other products. What about your underarm though? It gets dosed in antiperspirant daily, sometimes multiple times in a day. The aluminum is there to migrate to your sweat glands to prevent sweat coming out. It's like a plug.</p> <p>Sweating is one way for your body to remove toxins. When that is blocked they remain within your system. This aluminium also migrates to the blood stream.</p> <p>In 2016 Reading University in the United Kingdom released a <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997127'>study</a> which said spraying the underarm with antiperspirants containing aluminium adds additional exposure through the skin in the area of the upper outer quadrant of the breast. It also stated that this area of the breast has a 'disproportionately high incidence of breast cysts and breast cancer.'</p> <p>The study went on to say aluminium has a negative affect at a <em>cellular level</em> including the development of hallmarks associated with cancer.</p> <p>Here is the the most telling line from the study ' Aluminium has been shown to cause adverse alterations to the breast micro environment.'</p> <p>An earlier <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16045991'>study</a> by the same university (2005) said aluminium has a genotoxic profile that can alter DNA. Aluminium can interfere with oestrogen action and oestrogen is a well established influence in breast cancer.</p> <p>In 2008 Center Antoine-Lacassagne, Nice, France <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18829420'>concluded</a> there is no risk of breast cancer through the use of deodorant and antiperspirant.</p> <p>And therein lies the problem. Like most scientific studies, another study comes along and refutes the first and around and around we go. You have to decide based on your own interpretation and beliefs.</p> <p>I do not believe big pharmaceutical companies. For me, aluminium is a no-no. I don't want it in my body. Even if three quarters of the studies are incorrect, there are too many negatives in the remaining quarter.</p> <p>I'm also very aware that big business, multinational companies don't care about me.</p> <h3>2. Butane/Isobutane/Propane</h3> <p>According to the companies, these are used as a propellant and to assist with swift drying of the antiperspirant. No one wants to have sticky, wet armpits for ten minutes after application. They also cause that instant cooling feeling.</p> <p>Antiperspirants work by creating a very thin gel over the top of the sweat gland and the propellants enable the formation of this.</p> <p>The fact butane is derived from petroleum is enough to expel it from my life. There are <a href='https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb%3A%40term+%40DOCNO+944'>studies</a> that show inhalation of these propellants causes serious health effects or death.</p> <p>Inhaling the fumes directly to get high is a miserable thing to do. What about the millions of people around the world who apply their underarm in enclosed spaces like bathrooms and then spend the next ten minutes in there finishing their grooming? They do this every day.</p> <p>In a report from the United Kingdom a young teenager died after using excessive amounts of antiperspirant in a small space. <a href='https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/schoolgirl-12-died-inhaling-much-deodorant-used-like-going-fashion/'>'Analysis of brain samples revealed two substances present in aerosols&#8202;-&#8202;they are known as volatile substances. They are known to be present in deodorant which was present at the scene. Their presence is consistent with inhalation. Death may result from the toxicological effects. The substances are <strong>butane </strong>and <strong>isobutane</strong>'</a></p> <p>Given the origin of these chemicals and the likely side effects, I avoid them.</p> <h3>Cyclopentasiloxane</h3> <p>This is a silicon used as a delivery agent, lubricant and solvent. It is also anti-static. A <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_174.pdf'>study</a> from the Scientific Community on Community Safety (SCCS) said that when inhaled repeatedly (as you would do in an enclosed bathroom or bedroom) cyclopentasiloxane targets liver, lungs and uterus.</p> <p>The SCCS concluded that cyclopentasiloxane is safe at reported levels <em>in</em> hair styling aerosols and sun care spray products because the use of those products ' may lead to air concentrations above the value where SCCS considered it may be aerosolized and locally toxic'</p> <p>In other words, because you're spraying it in a manner that leaves particles in the air around your face and head, it's unacceptable. They say it is at acceptable levels in antiperspirant.</p> <p>Have you ever seen a teenage boy spray antiperspirant on himself in a bathroom? It's like a mist has descended and enveloped the entire room. It is all breathed in.</p> <h3>Sodium Benzoate</h3> <p>This is a man made chemical made by combining benzoic acid and sodium hydroxide. It is used as a preservative in foods and is found in soft drinks.</p> <p>You would consider this to be a safe chemical considering we consume it. It's found in tooth paste and mouthwash.</p> <p>It is used in industrial applications to deter corrosion in vehicle cooling systems, it's a stabilizer in photo processing and it is used to make plastic more durable.</p> <p>It can convert to benzene, a known carcinogen. Benzene has been found in soft drinks that contain sodium and vitamin c (abscorbic acid).</p> <p>It may cause <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229641'>inflammation</a>.</p> <p>A <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22538314'>study of college students</a> linked a high intake of beverages containing sodium benzoate to reports of ADHD. Although this study looked at the ingestion through soft drinks, this is sprayed on our porous skin!</p> <p>Many studies suggest sodium benzoate is fine in low doses. For me, anything that has an industrial application is going no where near my body!</p> <h3>Gelatin Crosspolymer ( hydrolyzed collagen)</h3> <p>Even the name sounds wrong. This is a skin conditioner and prevents the formation of bacteria. A quick bit of research on this ingredient for the antiperspirant I used for this provided me with a statement from the company.</p> <p>It stated that gelatin crosspolymer is used as a part of their technology that provides a boost of fragrance when you move and need it the most. It also stated it's derived from fish.</p> <ol> <li>If I buy a personal product, I don't necessarily want an animal to die so I can have nice smelling armpits.</li> <li>What chemical process do they put this collagen through to make it not smell like fish?</li> </ol> <h3>Silica</h3> <p>Silica is added to help absorb moisture when you sweat. If, like me, you get a rash on the armpit from antiperspirants, it may be the silica.</p> <p>Silica is also used in commercial products like cleansers, cosmetics, art clays and glazes, pet litter, talcum powder, caulk, putty, paint, and mortar.</p> <p>Yes, that chemical ingredient in your antiperspirant is also in paint, mortar, putty and caulk and is in those little absorbent bags in food product.</p> </div>`

        data: `<div> <p>And what you need to know about the Sit-Stand desks. </p> <p>As new technology is taking over the world, we rely more and more on the machines and lesser on doing things ourselves. Children don't go out to play in the parks anymore; instead, they spend their entire day sitting in one place, playing video games. Adults don't go out and meet people when they are 'bored', instead they spend the day binging on their favorite Netflix shows. Technology has made us lazy.</p> <p>With the progression of time, the jobs have changed too. The style of work is not the same it used to be 20 years back. People spend more time in front of a desk, working on their computers whether it is at their homes or an office.</p> <p>How many hours a day do you spend sitting? As bloggers, writers, freelancers, we all spend our fair share of time in the seats.</p> <p>But is that okay? Is sitting for excessive periods of time healthy for you?</p> <h4>Doctors and Professional have started to call Sitting as 'The New Smoking'.</h4> <p>Some sources even go as far as to say that smoking is safer than sitting. Sitting for more than 8 hours a day can promote depression, obesity, type-2 Diabetes and even blood pressure as seen in <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187798/'>research</a> published in AM J Public Health Journal is 2018.</p> <p>This is where the new <strong>Sit-Stand Desks</strong> come in. More and more offices have started to introduce these desks.</p> <h3>What is a Sit-Stand Desk?</h3> <p>A Sit-Stand Desk is an adjustable desk, which can be repositioned according to the user. If one is standing they can increase the height of the desk, and if sitting, they can lower it back down.</p> <p>This allows people to take a break from sitting, whilst not having to interrupt their work. This was intended to decrease the number of hours people spent sitting and decrease the rates of obesity and depression amongst office workers.</p> <p>To understand the effects of Sit-Stand desks more clearly, <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300304?via%3Dihub'>research</a> was undertaken recently by <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300304?via%3Dihub#!'>April J.Chambers</a>, <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300304?via%3Dihub#!'>Michelle M.Robertson</a>, and <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687019300304?via%3Dihub#!'>Nancy A.Baker</a>. The key aspects of this research were to study the effects of these desks on the user's behavior, physiology, posture, work Performance, and any discomfort.</p> <p>The selected participants were followed for up to 1 year, after which it was concluded that the Sit-Stand desks were able to improve the discomfort and change their behaviors&#8202;-&#8202;they spent more time standing than before.</p> <p>However, it had very little effects on work performance, posture, and health. It could be explained by the fact that the Sit-Stand Desks allow you to stand in one place, without any mobility which is not any better than sitting.</p> <p>Hence it was concluded that the way to reduce the harmful effects associated with prolonged sitting was NEAT which stands for Non-Exercise Thermogenesis.</p> <h3>What is NEAT?</h3> <p>'Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is the energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise. It includes the energy expended walking to work, performing yard work, undertaking agricultural tasks, and fidgeting'</p> <p>In easy words, the way to practice NEAT includes taking a break from work every few minutes and walking around, even if it is to the water cooler.</p> <p>According to Dr. Diaz, who is a professor at Columbia University: 'If you have a job or lifestyle that involves a lot of sitting, you can lower your risk of early death by moving more often, for as long as you want and as your ability allows&#8202;-&#8202;whether that means taking an hour-long high-intensity spin class or choosing lower-intensity activities, like walking,'.</p> <p>In his study, almost 8,000 people who were 45 years or older were selected and were asked to replace only 30 minutes of their sitting time with any low-intensity physical activity of their choice-like walking. It was found that by doing this, they were able to lower the risk of mortality by 17%.</p> <h4>The key here is that physical activity of any form is able to provide health benefits.</h4> <p>Anything that interrupts the continuous cycle of Sedimentary activity or breaks up the long hours of sitting and gets you up from your seat is enough<strong>.</strong></p> <h3>So let's make a promise to ourselves today.</h3> <p>With all the diseases and negativity in the world, let's make a promise today to prevent the preventable and prioritize our health over everything else.</p> </div>`

If we look at diabetes, we can take country estimates&#8202;-&#8202;in the US, that's <a href='https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/DiabetesAtlas.html'>about 9%</a> of the population, while in Australia we think it's <a href='https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/diabetes/diabetes-snapshot/contents/how-many-australians-have-diabetes'>closer to 6%</a>&#8202;-&#8202;but the problem is that we know that these estimates <a href='https://static.diabetesaustralia.com.au/s/fileassets/diabetes-australia/e7282521-472b-4313-b18e-be84c3d5d907.pdf'>are flawed</a>.</p> <p>Partially that's because of the limitations of our monitoring systems, but a bigger part is that a lot of people are living out there, undiagnosed, with chronic diseases.</p> <p>Let me introduce you to the rule of halves.</p> <h4>Halving Health</h4> <p>The rule of halves was originally established when scientists in the 1970s were looking at people with <a href='https://www.bmj.com/content/300/6730/981'>high blood pressure</a>. They noticed an astonishing thing: while many people had high blood pressure, only half of them had been diagnosed by their doctor. If you just relied on the official figures&#8202;-&#8202;based on people self-reporting whether a doctor had diagnosed them&#8202;-&#8202;you'd underestimate the rate of high blood pressure by an enormous amount.</p> <p>Even scarier, they found that, while 50% of people were being diagnosed with high blood pressure, only half of THOSE people were being treated for the disease. So of the total population who had the problem, only 25% were being treated. Scarier still, only half of that small subgroup were getting to their targets, which means that of all the people with the disease, only a small fraction were being treated appropriately.</p> <p>It was a pretty terrifying finding.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QtxltwpYwjde5E--8FhQ_A.jpeg'> </figure> <p>And in the decades that followed, scientists found the same thing again and again: <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1371996/?page=1'>about half</a> of all people with high blood pressure&#8202;-&#8202;and a <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1371996/?page=1'>range of other chronic diseases</a> &#8202;-&#8202;remain undiagnosed. Of those who do get diagnosed, half are treated. Of those treated, half are treated effectively.</p> <p>Now, it's important to note that this is not true for ALL chronic diseases. Problems like <a href='https://www.copdfoundation.org/What-is-COPD/Understanding-COPD/What-is-COPD.aspx'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>, where people have very severe symptoms and almost always seek help, are usually diagnosed at much higher rates. But when you've got diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure, where the symptoms are often easy to live with until they're not, it's a recipe for a huge undiagnosed population.</p> <h4>What Do We Do?</h4> <p>This brings us to an important question: what can we do about the problem? We know that a lot of people are living undiagnosed with chronic health issues&#8202;-&#8202;for diabetes, the World Health Organization estimates it's <a href='https://www.who.int/diabetes/global-report/en/'>at least 20%</a> of all people with the disease&#8202;-&#8202;but it seems like a hard problem to solve.</p> <p>Well, the first thing is something that my team and I are working on, which is improving our detection of diabetes. In 2014, we knew there was a problem, with many people walking into the hospital had no idea that they were sick, so we <a href='https://drc.bmj.com/content/4/1/e000191?utm_source=trendmd&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=alljjs&amp;utm_content=americas&amp;utm_term=1-B'>conducted a pilot testing program</a> to see just how big that number was.</p> <p>It turned out that 30% of all the people with diabetes in our hospital had no idea that they had the disease.</p> <p>So, in 2016, we made this type of testing routine. We aren't screening the whole population, because we know from the literature that this isn't an effective/cost-effective way to go about it, but we test high-risk people to make sure we catch as many of them as possible.</p> <p>After two years of this testing, we found consistently that 17% of all people attending our hospital tested positive for diabetes, but fewer and fewer were undiagnosed.</p> <p>So far, so good.</p> <p>But hospitals aren't a great proxy for the community&#8202;-&#8202;mostly quite sick people go to hospitals, and we wanted to know if this situation was outside of our ivory tower. So we decided to do the same kind of testing, but in general practice clinics, where the patients were much more like your average person on the street.</p> <p>Much to our surprise, we found the exact same results as that initial hospital testing. 17% diabetes, many people completely unaware they had the disease. The paper is <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822718318862'>here if you want to read it</a>.</p> <p>What does all this mean? Well, firstly, that we haven't solved the problem. There are still a lot of people out there living undiagnosed with chronic disease. Even worse, health equity is a huge issue in who gets diagnosed and treated, with people who are at a higher risk of social disadvantage&#8202;-&#8202;for example, because of low income or inability to speak the country's language&#8202;-&#8202;seeing much higher rates of undiagnosed disease.</p> <p>But there is a ray of hope&#8202;-&#8202; <a href='https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/11/e023211'>a Danish study</a> found that, although many people with diabetes don't get diagnosed, if they are diagnosed they are usually treated, and often achieve their targets. Over 90% of diagnosed people were treated, and 40-60% of those were treated effectively.</p> <p>Lots of people are sick, but we can fix that.</p> <p>Ultimately, it seems like the rule of halves is still an issue, but it might not be for very long. We've shown that you can increase the number of people who are aware of their disease pretty easily&#8202;-&#8202;the tests are often quite cheap&#8202;-&#8202;and we also know that this will probably make a huge difference to their health long-term. Even more, fixing this problem will probably help make our health more equitable, but reducing the impact of missed diagnoses in for the most vulnerable people in our society.</p> <p>The first step to solving any problem is knowing how big the problem is.</p> <p>The next step is doing something about it.</p> <p>* <em>Note: In this article I'm mostly talking about type 2 diabetes, rather than type 1, gestational, or medication-induced/other diabetes. Type 2 diabetes makes up 95% of all diabetes, so while it is important to remember that it is not the only issue, it makes up the majority of undiagnosed/underdiagnosed cases.</em></p> </div>`

They're in restaurants, coffee shops, bookstores, department stores, and city parks&#8202;-&#8202;kids staring down, lost in their cell phones or other electronic gadgets, with earbuds jammed in their ears, completely oblivious to the world around them.</p> <p>Many times, the music they're playing on their phone is so loud, an observer can hear it from several feet away.</p> <p>While much research has examined how the overuse of technology affects children's brain development, a new concern is arising regarding the risks children face for premature hearing loss-particularly when using earbuds.</p> <h3><strong>All-Day Audio</strong></h3> <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the dawn of the MP3 player back in 2001, 13% of American children between ages 6 and 19 have acquired some level of noise-induced hearing loss.</p> <p>That's more than 5 million young people.</p> <p>According to audiologists, today, <a href='http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/generation-deaf-doctors-warn-dangers-ear-buds-n360041'>hearing loss in teens is about 30% higher</a> now now than it was in the 1980s and 1990s. Though teens have always gone to rock concerts, which pose a great threat of premature hearing loss, the significant increase in hearing loss among today's generation of younger people is being attributed to the daily use of earbuds.</p> <p>Twenty-five years ago, people used their Sony Walkman Personal Stereos for about half an hour per day, either while jogging, working out, or doing some other short-term activity.</p> <blockquote>When the activity was finished, so was their listening time.</blockquote> <p>They were also using headphones that went over the ears. Back then, it wasn't as common to turn the volume up too high because the simpler technology meant the sound would become distorted. At the same time, these devices ran on two AA carbon batteries with limited lifespans, so using them for hours on end wasn't an option.</p> <p>Today, cell phones and MP3 players can last for years and have batteries that are rechargeable. Kids can listen to music or watch videos for hours on end while using earbuds that are inserted into the ear canal, often just a half inch from the eardrum.</p> <p>The digital technology makes sound crystal clear, so there is no real incentive to keep it low. In fact, kids have a strong tendency to turn the volume up to drown out exterior noise from things like crowds and traffic.</p> <p>With earbuds being so close to the hearing mechanism inside the ear, the risk of hearing damage occurring at lower levels is very real.</p> <p>Simply because they place the source of sound closer to the eardrum, earbuds have been shown to increase volume by 9 decibels when compared to other hearing appliances.</p> <blockquote>Based on the increase in patients audiologists are seeing, it's been estimated that anywhere between <a href='http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9797364'>15% and 25% of children</a> listen to their devices at hazardous levels.</blockquote> <h3><strong>How Hearing Happens</strong></h3> <p>The cochlea or small snail-shaped inner ear chamber is where hearing happens. It's lined with 16,000 tiny hair cells that vibrate at different frequencies. It's those vibrations that get translated into nerve signals and sound perceptions.</p> <p>We know that loud noise damages and even kills these fragile hair cells, and once gone, they never regenerate. Hearing loss is cumulative over a lifetime, and any amount of hearing loss is irreversible. Because it comes on gradually, many people don't notice it until they're in their 40s or 50s, often experiencing the kind of hearing loss that isn't normally seen until the 70's.</p> <p>New research from Harvard Medical School's Eaton Peabody Laboratory is now showing that the nerve synapses in the inner ear are more vulnerable to damage than the hair cells themselves.</p> <p>A series of experiments with young animals showed that even a single exposure to loud noise accelerates hearing loss later in life. This is mostly due to damage done to nerve synapses. In fact, a person can lose up to 90% of their cochlear hair cells and still be able to detect a tone in a quiet room. However, once background noise is introduced, hearing ability drops dramatically.</p> <p>So while a person's hair cells may be largely intact, they can still experience hearing loss if <a href='http://www.newswise.com/articles/noise-induced-hidden-hearing-loss-mechanism-discovered'>the nerve synapses are damaged</a>.</p> <p>When a nerve fiber is damaged, it never reconnects or responds to sounds. Within a few months or years, the neuron itself shrivels and disappears. Earbuds are of particular concern because they deliver stronger, more damaging sound waves straight to the cochlea, even at lower volumes.</p> <p>Typical signs of hearing loss include ringing, roaring, hissing or buzzing sounds in the ear, difficulty understanding speech in noisy places or locations with poor acoustics, muffled sounds or a feeling of fullness in the ear, and listening to radio or TV at higher levels than in the past. Anyone experiencing these kinds of symptoms should be examined by a professional.</p> <h3><strong>How Loud is Too Loud?</strong></h3> <p>According to the National Institutes of Health, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or <a href='http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/06/11/avoid-hearing-loss-check-decibels-before-entering-room.html'>above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss</a>. To put this into perspective, normal speech registers at about 60 decibels.</p> <p>City traffic can reach 85 decibels, as does the volume in movie theaters, although it has peaks that are much higher.</p> <p>A lawnmower registers at 90 decibels, a chainsaw at 100, and a rock concert or stadium noise range from 110-120. Most MP3 players today can produce volumes up to 120 decibels. At that level, permanent hearing loss can occur in as little as 8 minutes. The louder the noise, the shorter amount of exposure is required to create permanent hearing loss.</p> <p>Anything under 75 decibels is considered healthy. By contrast, a noisy lunchroom full of screaming middle-schoolers averages about 89 decibels. There's a reason why teachers keep telling children to quiet down during lunchtime, and it's not because they're boring adults who don't know how to have fun!</p> <p>And here's something important to note: This is about the same level of noise an MP3 player produces at just 70% of volume.</p> <h3><strong>Setting Healthy Levels</strong></h3> <p>The most effective way to preserve hearing is to stop using earbuds completely because they place sound too close to the inner ear. Stop using headphones, as well. If you must use headphones, choose the highest quality you can find and be sure they fit completely over the ear, so there is little temptation to turn up the volume.</p> <blockquote>If someone can hear 'leakage' from your headphones from several feet away, the volume is too loud.</blockquote> <p>Likewise, if you can't hear anything going on in the environment around you with your headphones on, the sound level is too high.</p> <p>Many cell phones and MP3 players can lock sound at lower levels. This can be a great tool to train yourself to get accustomed to lower levels and prevent children from getting into the habit of turning the volume up all the time.</p> <p>Regardless of where you are or what you're doing, the general sound rule is that if you have to raise your voice to be heard, it's too loud.</p> <p>When using headphones, most doctors and audiologists recommend following the 60/60 rule.</p> <blockquote>Headphone usage should be limited to 60 minutes per day at 60% of the maximum volume or less.</blockquote> <p>Just by making these simple changes, you'll be able to preserve your hearing your child's for a lifetime.</p> <h4>For more health and inspirational insights from Dr. Sadeghi, please visit <a href='https://behiveofhealing.com/'>Behiveofhealing.com</a> to sign up for the monthly newsletter, check out his annual health and well-being journal, <a href='https://beingclarity.com/product/megazen-well-being-journal-volume-6/'>MegaZEN</a>, or for messages of encouragement and humor, follow him on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/beingclaritynow/'>Instagram</a>and<a href='https://twitter.com/beingclaritynow'> Twitter </a>@beingclaritynow.</h4> </div>`
