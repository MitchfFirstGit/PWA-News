Its revenue has grown from $7B in 2004 to $232B in 2018. Amazon has never been particularly profitable but that is also changing. Its profits tripled between 2017 and 2018 to $10B. Both Amazon's revenue and profits are on a seemingly never-ending upward acceleration.</p> <p>What has made them so successful? Can we replicate what they do to boost our businesses?</p> <p>I would like to ask you three questions that can be answered by studying Amazon. I'm suggesting that these three questions, if answered and implemented, will boost your business.</p> <h3>1) What to focus on?</h3> <p>Amazon has 14 leadership principles. By far the most important principle is the first&#8202;-&#8202; <strong>Customer Obsession</strong>.</p> <p>Customer experience has been an increasing focus for most companies, but no company has been as fanatical at this than Amazon.</p> <blockquote>'If there's one reason we have done better than any of our peers in the Internet space over the last six years, it is because we have focused like a laser on customer experience, and that really does matter, I think, in any business. It certainly matters online, where word-of-mouth is so very, very powerful.'&#8202;-&#8202;Jeff Bezos</blockquote> <p>Here are a few benefits of being customer obsessed:</p> <p>&#183; Customers are up to 6 times more expensive to win than retain. Keep the ones you have.</p> <p>&#183; Happy customers buy and pay more, e.g., Amazon Prime.</p> <p>&#183; Customers can become brand advocates, which leads to referral business.</p> <p>&#183; You can identify when your customer's demands change and then make the necessary changes to your business.</p> <p>&#183; Your staff, and you, will be happier and more productive.</p> <p>Amazon will go as far as reducing prices, and change business processes to their disadvantage, to the betterment of their customers.</p> <h3>2) What to do?</h3> <p>Amazon has created a Human Centred Design process called<strong> Working Backwards</strong>.</p> <p>'Start with the customer and work backwards'&#8202;-&#8202;Jeff Bezos.</p> <p>Working Backwards is used to answer the following 5 questions:</p> <p>&#183; Who is your customer?</p> <p>&#183; What is the most important problem or opportunity?</p> <p>&#183; What is the most important customer benefit?</p> <p>&#183; How do you know what your customer needs or wants?</p> <p>&#183; What does the experience look like?</p> <p>The Working Backwards output is not a Powerpoint slide deck but rather a press release. Here are some guidelines for the press release:</p> <p>&#183; No more than 1 page.</p> <p>&#183; Language understandable to a 12-year-old.</p> <p>&#183; Testimonial expressing the 'Wow!' factor.</p> <p>&#183; Assume customers will only read the first paragraph.</p> <p>&#183; Leave more complex aspects for the FAQ.</p> <p>For more information on the Working Backwards methodology, I have written a complete blog on the topic that can be found <a href='https://www.ideastorm.co.za/single-post/2019/03/11/The-Working-Backwards-innovation-methodology'>here</a>.</p> <h3>3) How to do it?</h3> <p>The ' <strong>Flywheel Effect</strong> ' was a term created by Jim Collins in his book 'Good to Great'. A flywheel is a self-reinforcing loop made up of a few key initiatives. Those initiatives feed and are in turn driven by each other, and build a long-term business.</p> <p>Amazon uses the concept of the Flywheel and has taken it to the extreme. This is one of the key reasons for their success and accelerating revenues.</p> <p>Jeff Bezos spoke about how the success of Amazon.com has fueled the launch of Amazon Prime Video.</p> <blockquote>'Because we have this unusual way to monetize the premium content, we can charge less for the premium content than we would otherwise have to charge, if we didn't have the flywheel spinning to help sell more shoes'&#8202;-&#8202;Jeff Bezos.</blockquote> <p>I have written a comprehensive blog on the amazing Flywheel Effect that can be found <a href='https://medium.com/swlh/the-amazing-flywheel-effect-80a0a21a5ea7'>here</a>.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>I am absolutely sure that if you implement the results of these three questions into your business that it will accelerate its performance.</p> <p>The three questions are:</p> <p>Question 1: What to focus on?</p> <p>Answer: Focus on <strong>Customer Obsession </strong>and have it as your number one principle.</p> <p>Question 2: What to do?</p> <p>Answer: Work out what the customer wants using the <strong>Working Backwards</strong> methodology.</p> <p>Question 3: How to do it?</p> <p>Answer: Place your effort into activities that cause a <strong>Flywheel Effect</strong>.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed this article and that it makes an impact in your life and adds to the success of your business.</p> <p>I am always interested in your stories and thoughts which can be emailed to me at <a href='mailto:lancepeppler@gmail.com'>lancepeppler@gmail.com</a> or visit my website <a href='http://www.lancepeppler.com'>www.lancepeppler.com</a>.</p> <em>The views of this blog are my own and don't represent the views of the company I work for.</em> </div>`

        data:`<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*d35Gqkl0sY3OesTfys9W6A.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Seed round financing refers to money raised in the earliest stages of running a startup and usually represents the initial capital raised by a company. It's financing that is literally going to 'plant the seeds' for your company's future growth. You might have a stellar business plan, a working prototype, and even a few paying customers, but guess what? You still need money to purchase equipment, hire full-time staff, and rent out an office. So how much should you raise?</p> <p>The easy answer, of course, is 'as much as you can.' Imagine how easy things would be if you could raise enough seed stage capital that you would never have to go back to investors again in order to ask for more money. In a best-case scenario, you should try to raise enough money so that you can take your company to profitability. But realistically, you are only looking to get enough runway for the next 12 to 18 months at which point, yes, you'll need to go back to investors and raise your Series A round.</p> <p>There are several benchmarks for how much seed round capital you should raise. Assuming you're a tech company bringing a new product to market, you should count on having a team of 5 engineers (or developers). As a rule of thumb, simply multiply this figure by $15,000 for every month of the runway you are trying to create for a company. Using a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, you can immediately see that a five-person Silicon Valley startup is usually looking to raise between $1 million and $1.5 million for an 18-month period. (This is just math: $15,000 x 5 x 18 = $1.35 million) If you're based in a more affordable tech hub, you might be able to play around these figures and realize that you need considerably less than $15,000 per month. But that's what a ballpark figure does&#8202;-&#8202;it puts you in the right ballpark.</p> <p>When all is said and done, the minimum amount to raise during a seed round stage is typical $500,000 (which works out to roughly enough to afford 3 employees for 12 months). For an amount less than that, you can probably just go back to friends, families, and the deep-pocketed angel investor who happens to live in your neighborhood. If you're looking to raise more than $1.5 million, you might need to revisit your business plan to see where you are going wrong. (You might need to adjust from your 'best case' scenario to your 'base case' scenario).</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*U0RSzKRrEsmJDKYdRBB9Cw.jpeg'> </figure> <p>One important point to keep in mind is that the seed round is no longer an equity round. In layman's terms, it means that you and your partners (who own 100 percent of the company) no longer need to give up an equity stake so early in the lifecycle of your company. In Silicon Valley, seed rounds are typically financed with convertible debt (or similar types of debt instruments that convert into equity at some later date). Your Series A round will be your equity round, so don't worry, there will be plenty of future opportunities to give away ownership in your company.</p> <p>Once you've raised your initial seed round, it's time to get down to the serious business of pushing your company one step closer to profitability. The better the financial condition of your company after a period of 12 months, the better terms you will be able to negotiate with VC investors later.</p> </div>`

He turned his experiences with cutthroat salespeople into the play <em>Glengarry Glen Ross.</em> This play and the subsequent film won multiple awards on Broadway and at the Oscars.</p> <p>Today, Mamet offers two rules for succeeding first as an artist and second as a business person.</p> <blockquote>He said, 'You've got to do one thing for your art every day, and you've got to do one thing for your business every day.'</blockquote> <h3>Focus On What Success Looks Like</h3> <p>As an entrepreneur, starting a business is one of the most creative acts you can undertake.</p> <p>An ability to create products, services and offers represents your craft, whereas the bottom line reflects the health of your business.</p> <p>When I first heard Mamet's advice, I pictured a bearded recluse hunched over his desk working by candlelight and etching out <em>War and Peace</em> with an fancy quill pen.</p> <p>That's not reality. A boss, spouse, child or even a bank manager will need your attention at some point.</p> <p>Still, it's relatively easy to work on your improving your craft and building your business every day if you focus on what counts.</p> <h3>Start Small</h3> <p>In 1996, 23-year-old Kevin Plank created athletic undershirts that stayed dry (craft) during difficult workouts.

Failure hurts the ego, ruins and alters plans, and it at times, make us feel like we are not good enough.</p> <p>In my career and life, I have been plagued by failure and the notion of not being good enough.</p> <p>When I tell people about having over 20 companies, sometimes I fail to say that the majority of them actually failed, went out of business, or I had to close down prematurely for a variety of reasons.</p> <p>Society has made the notion of failure seem so damn negative but as we all know very well... this 'failure' thing is pretty fucking normal. Nobody is really 'always winning', it just doesn't happen&#8202;-&#8202;haaa</p> <p>Though, there are those that see 'failure' in a completely different manner.<br>This is actually a defining factor between those that are becoming masters of their destiny and those that will become victims of their history!</p> <p>How do you look at things that do not go as planned? Or at possible 'failures'?</p> <p>It is actually a simple choice, but ONLY simple once you become truly aware of the controllable difference... Something that most of our schooling systems have not consciously picked up and implemented just yet. <br>So, the ease of being able to tell the difference has not been so damn easy if your parents, teachers, friends, and even the television has been telling you to avoid failing at all costs.</p> <p>I mean common now, schooling has actually taught us to gain security in the safest way possible. Which at one point, job security once existed, but not in today's world! Not with how fast things are changing and evolving.<br>Sadly enough, this is an antiquated notion that is still being taught in many schools.</p> <p>The majority of the time, they have not been giving us the entire picture. Keeping us from a bigger picture of opportunity that actually comes from 'failure'.</p> <p>KNOWING FROM EXPERIENCE:</p> <p>It is within my failures, the challenges, and the hardest of times that I have come to realize, lay forth the greatest catalysts of growth.</p> <p>It is in my failures that have brought forth the most insightful and meaningful realizations in my life, more so than anything else.</p> <p>If it wasn't for the failures, corrections, downturns, and mistakes... I would have never gone harder into my studies, looked deeper into situations, and really found great appreciation when things really did 'go well or as expected'.</p> <p>In this screenshot here stands a great example of what some may perceive as a 'failure'.</p> <p>This was one of our stores that we scaled up to $221k in the first 3 weeks of opening it up! And then crashing down into the negative due to a variety of unforeseen factors.</p> <p>I actually had a friend with a marketing agency and a fulfillment center do almost the exact thing that happened here. The exact same product, almost the exact revenue per time period, and very similar problems that we had.</p> <p>Within a couple of months, I believe they completely shut down operations with the bank holding on to their money.<br>But the difference here was that when they saw failure, we actually saw the learning lessons at the end of the tunnel. We continued to push forward, despite the defeat we were feeling during it all.</p> <p>PERSPECTIVE:</p> <p>We were losing money for weeks, in upwards of almost $1,000 a day, Paypal and Shopify were holding over $80k of our money due to extremely fast scaling and not fast enough shipping, I was literally working 18 hours a day to fix the issues that ensued, and we had a giant paid for shipment STUCK in China with no way of getting here in time for Christmas.</p> <p>Just trying to find the replacements orders was an absolute nightmare, the cost was now double, and I was going to sleep at 5 to 6AM, night after night talking to Chinese suppliers.</p> <p>We decided to offer all late customers their money back for tardiness and all kinds of bonuses if they were to just wait a little longer. Losing us quite a bit of money but helped us save face, partially at least.</p> <p>I honestly felt like quitting and going back to more agency work, to take on more clients that I wasn't even inspired about anymore, as boredom had previously started to ensue for me in that world...</p> <p>3 FEET FROM GOLD</p> <p>I tend to use this phrase quite often because it is not something that has happened to me once... but several times!</p> <p>It may have been seen as something that many cannot come back from... but we saw this mistake as a huge learning lesson for the future.</p> <p>Since this screenshot of failure about a year and a half ago... we have now done over 5 Million dollars in revenue in this one store alone! Who in the hell would have thought??</p> <p>I cannot stress this enough but I see the majority of entrepreneurs quit as the tough gets going. Over 95% of entrepreneurs are struck with shiny object syndrome and the failure rate is even higher!</p> <p>It is always darkest before you can see the light.</p> <p>Thanks<br>Jonathan<br>The Digital Frontiersman</p> <p>PS&#8202;-&#8202;This was a post I promised to post last year but never got the chance to.

How do you know if it has failed and you need to kill it?' I asked.</p> <blockquote>'The best teams set exit criteria' Nick Coster replied. Nick, the co-founder of <a href='https://brainmates.com.au/'>Brainmates</a>, one of Australia's top product manager trainers, went on to explain that the best teams he has worked with set their criteria upfront. What does success or failure for their new product or new product feature look like?</blockquote> <p>Let's unpack this statement because within it there is so much gold to be had. Let's understand why doing this is essential and also how you can implement it for your teams.</p> <h3>5 Types of Success Criteria for New Product</h3> <p>Setting your success criteria at the outset has a range of benefits. These are five things to consider:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Focuses everyone on what matters. </strong>Having a clearly defined criteria for what will lead to success will focus everyone on the most important activities that are needed in order to make the feature a success. It will help cut out all those activities that seem like they 'should' be done but really aren't necessary or aren't necessary right now, in order to gauge the success of your new feature.</li> <li> <strong>Avoid emotion perpetuating in a product or feature. </strong>One of the greatest drivers of poor decisions is emotion (just ask leading investors like Buffett or Howard Marks). You fall in love with the feature, you don't want the feature to fail because you fear job loss, you desperately want it to succeed to prove something to the world, you're greedy because some financial incentive is perceived to be there. Setting clear criteria as early as possible removes the emotion.</li> <li> <strong>Ensure what you're doing is achievable, useful, or valuable. </strong>Taking the time to determine your success or failure criteria at the outset usually, by its very nature, causes you to consider how the feature will be valuable to the business, be useful to customers and be achievable.</li> <li> <strong>Kill bad ideas ahead of time. </strong>Thinking about the criteria might lead you to kill the idea before you waste time and money on it. You may realize that, in order to be successful, the activities you need or the success criteria is unachievable or provides no value to the business.</li> <li> <strong>Alignment on expectations.</strong> You're most likely operating with a team, whether you're in a company with thousands of people working on product or you're in a startup. <a href='https://www.terem.com.au/expectations-new-product/'>Setting expectations at the outset for new products</a> has huge benefits that will help avoid arguments and difficulties further down the track, when things have or haven't gone as planned.</li> </ol> <p>Lastly, you wouldn't make an investment in stock or property without some kind of expectation of the return you want. So don't invest in your product without an idea of what the return will be.</p> <h3>7 Ways to Apply Success Criteria</h3> <p>Now that you understand the benefits of setting success criteria for new features and new products, you'll be looking at how to apply this. Here are some useful guidelines to use in order to get the most out of setting success criteria:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Choose only one metric.</strong> This makes it easier for teams to rally around, easier to understand, and easier to focus on the activities that are important (and not so important). The one caveat to choosing one metric is that you may need a counter-metric or two.</li> <li> <strong>Choose a metric as closely aligned as possible to both customer success and business success</strong>. It's OK to spend more time here than you think is needed to really ensure the metric you are choosing is as close to measuring whether a customer is getting value <em>and</em> the business is or will receive value. If you aren't addressing both then be careful, it may be that you're measuring a vanity metric or setting yourself up for a product feature that isn't going to move the needle.</li> <li> <strong>Make the metric specific to the feature/product you are creating.</strong> Personally, most of my mistakes have been from using general metrics where a more specific metric, specific to my exact product, would have better allowed me to set success criteria. For instance, <em>active users</em> is often touted as a way to set success criteria but if you haven't previously had clarity on what an active user means to your product then active users is just a vanity number.</li> <li> <strong>Change the metric if you need.</strong> If you discover that the metric you have chosen isn't the best one you could be using to judge success or failure, then change it. Just don't change it to make it easier to pass so you feel good.</li> <li> <strong>Make it a measure of people and their behavior.</strong> Usually products are about changing behavior in some way or taking action in some way for people. So the closer your metric is to people and their behavior the more likely it is a better measure of success.</li> <li> <strong>Write out what you will do for different results. </strong>For example, if 20 messages are sent with this new feature by each customer then it is a success. If only 5 messages are sent each week then it is a failure.</li> <li> <strong>Use a hypothesis if you don't have the data.</strong> Using a hypothesis driven approach will let you keep moving and keep things measurable. There are also more <a href='https://www.terem.com.au/benefits-hypothesis-driven-approach-new-product-development-large-organisations/'>benefits to a hypothesis-driven approach</a>.</li> </ol> <p>Now you know how and why to set success criteria for your new feature or product, so when you and your team are celebrating product success, you'll know it's for the right reasons.</p> </div>`

The reality of climate change and its global impact is fostering innovative startups eager to make change. With the rapid evolution of technology, digitalization opportunities&#8202;-&#8202;in a traditionally low-tech, complex industry- open a variety of applications to the global chain. An increase in desired wellness has also resulted in changes in consumer diets, facilitating the rise of vegetarianism and veganism. According to the Mintel Global Food and Drink Trends 2017 report, there was a<a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/30/trends-for-2017-show-wellness-and-foods-link-to-grow.html'> 257 percent increase in the number of vegan food and beverage launches in 2016</a>, compared to 5 years ago.</p> <p>The food and beverage industry is changing&#8202;-&#8202;that much is clear. Let's delve into 2019 food tech trends that are pulling us forward to more nutrition, more transparency, and increased utilization of technology.</p> <h3>Top Food Technology Trends Transforming Food and Agriculture</h3> <h4>1. Plant-based and Animal Free</h4> <p>Improved technologies focused on animal product substitutes continue to grow and get new investments. Wildfire tragedies in California and <a href='https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2806/prolonged-hot-dry-conditions-affect-european-crop-prices/'>reduction of crop yields in many European countries</a> brought even more focus to climate change, which is directly associated with animal farming and meat consumption due to high emissions of greenhouse gases. Impossible Foods recently launched the 2.0 version of its vegan burger, which was <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2019/01/11/the-new-impossible-burger-2-0-won-everyones-mouth-at-ces-2019-but-thats-just-the-beginning/#69b3370727c4'>the winner in the top tech category at CES 2019</a>. As prices decrease and sensorial quality increase, these products will gain more popularity among all consumer groups.</p> <h4>2. Service Robots and Restaurant Digitalization</h4> <p>Although expensive, food service robots will be making their way in 2019 as well as new e-restaurants such as <a href='https://www.spyce.com/'>Spyce</a> and <a href='https://www.eatsa.com/'>Eatsa</a>. By bringing together the convenience of ordering online, personalization of meals, access to healthy and nutritious ingredients, and the speed of getting food at a counter, service robots and e-restaurants are setting new standards. <a href='https://cafexapp.com/'>CafeX</a>'s robot arm is trained to prepare the perfect cappuccino and the <a href='https://caliburger.com/'>burger flipper robot</a> is a grilling master. What will be next?</p> <h4>3. Plastic Free</h4> <p>Last year was a turning point for the CPG space with many important changes in international regulations and the signature of agreements.

Furthermore, CPG giants, such as Danone and Coca-Cola, as well as important global generators of plastic waste, got together during <a href='https://ourocean2018.org/'>Our Ocean Global Conference</a> and signed an ambitious agreement to significantly reduce plastic generation and disposal.

Check out <a href='https://www.rocketspace.com/corporate-innovation/topic/packaging-innovation'>my last article on packaging innovation</a> with a list of leading startups and corporations in the space.</p> <h4>4. Big Food, Transparency, and Common Values</h4> <p>The big food industry is still trying to figure out how to regain trust from customers, to be more aligned with their values, and to be more transparent. The boom of small brands and new e-commerce channels will continue to negatively impact the market share of the big players; in order to remain competitive, they must gain a better understanding of niche markets and the velocity to change gears. Traceability enablers, such as blockchain technology, will continue to expand and get new adopters in Food and Ag, as they enable fast data integration and identification of quality and origin of products. Interesting startups providing solutions include <a href='http://www.ripe.io/'>Ripe.io</a>, <a href='https://tefoodint.com/'>TE-FOOD</a>, and <a href='https://www.provenance.org/'>Provenance</a>.</p> <h4>5. Functional Beverage Boom</h4> <p>Low sugar, plant-based, functional beverages such as Kombucha, will continue to boom in 2019. <a href='https://www.bevindustry.com/articles/90063-kombucha-market-up-41-percent?v=preview'>The kombucha market, alone, increased nearly 41% to $534 million wholesale in 2017</a> and is expected to be worth <a href='https://www.fooddive.com/news/why-kombucha-sales-are-up-41/438398/'>$1.8 billion by 2020</a>. Howard Telford, Senior Beverage Analyst at Euromonitor International, commented on the current push for functional beverages into the meal space saying, <a href='https://www.fooddive.com/news/why-kombucha-sales-are-up-41/438398/'>'There's a shift toward consumers viewing beverages as a sort of preventative nutrition occasion. People are interested in functionality, and instead of asking 'What's in this bottle,' they're asking 'What is this bottle doing for me?'</a> High launch numbers in the pre and probiotic beverage and wellness drink space in 2018 highlighted how the convenience of drinking met the search for health and nutrition. New ingredients such as cannabis, mushrooms, MCT oil, new fibers, natural extracts, and pre/probiotics will continue to boost the creation of innovative, new beverages. Just take a look at <a href='https://www.remedyorganics.com/'>Remedy Organics</a>, <a href='https://whalebirdkombucha.com/'>Whalebird Kombucha</a>, and <a href='http://malkorganics.com/'>Malk Organics</a>.</p> <h4>6. Personalized and Special Diets</h4> <p>Digitalization and robotization increase the ability for personalization of food products, which is timely as demand is rapidly growing due to the spread of new diets and low-cost home-testing health diagnostics such as <a href='https://foodmarble.com/'>FoodMarble</a> and <a href='https://habit.com/'>Habit</a>. An increase in food allergies and intolerances worldwide will also give a boost to this trend. Solutions include meal plans such as <a href='https://www.platejoy.com/'>Platejoy</a>, which offers meal plans tailored to specific diets and cooking habits and integrates nutritional data with health tracking devices. Another example is <a href='https://sunbasket.com/'>Sunbasket</a>, a meal kit focused on special diets and organic ingredients. Full personalization of individual meals is still a challenge, but demand will push for innovations to continue in 2019.</p> <h4>7. Healthy E-food</h4> <p>Online food and e-commerce platforms will continue to grow and gain new adopters, as consumers continue to look for more convenient ways to shop. Successful grocery delivery services such as <a href='https://www.instacart.com/'>Instacart</a>, <a href='https://www.goodeggs.com/'>Good Eggs</a>, and <a href='https://www.imperfectproduce.com/'>Imperfect Produce</a> exemplify the expanding market. In food service, <a href='https://www.grubhub.com/'>Grubhub</a> and <a href='https://www.ubereats.com/'>Uber Eats</a> delivery solutions will continue to grow as well, while new and optimized platforms focused on targeted groups, special diets, and nutritional data insights might occupy an interesting space in 2019.</p> <h3>Accelerate Food Tech Trends</h3> <p>Now, more than ever is the time to come together to transform our food systems and consumption.
