src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dqi9uQTKSaNawJIMAT48Ag.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Amazon is the most successful company of our time. Its revenue has grown from $7B in 2004 to $232B in 2018. Amazon has never been particularly profitable but that is also changing. Its profits tripled between 2017 and 2018 to $10B. Both Amazon's revenue and profits are on a seemingly never-ending upward acceleration.</p> <p>What has made them so successful? Can we replicate what they do to boost our businesses?</p> <p>I would like to ask you three questions that can be answered by studying Amazon. I'm suggesting that these three questions, if answered and implemented, will boost your business.</p> <h3>1) What to focus on?</h3> <p>Amazon has 14 leadership principles. By far the most important principle is the first&#8202;-&#8202; <strong>Customer Obsession</strong>.</p> <p>Customer experience has been an increasing focus for most companies, but no company has been as fanatical at this than Amazon.</p> <blockquote>'If there's one reason we have done better than any of our peers in the Internet space over the last six years, it is because we have focused like a laser on customer experience, and that really does matter, I think, in any business. It certainly matters online, where word-of-mouth is so very, very powerful.'&#8202;-&#8202;Jeff Bezos</blockquote> <p>Here are a few benefits of being customer obsessed:</p> <p>&#183; Customers are up to 6 times more expensive to win than retain. Keep the ones you have.</p> <p>&#183; Happy customers buy and pay more, e.g., Amazon Prime.</p> <p>&#183; Customers can become brand advocates, which leads to referral business.</p> <p>&#183; You can identify when your customer's demands change and then make the necessary changes to your business.</p> <p>&#183; Your staff, and you, will be happier and more productive.</p> <p>Amazon will go as far as reducing prices, and change business processes to their disadvantage, to the betterment of their customers.</p> <h3>2) What to do?</h3> <p>Amazon has created a Human Centred Design process called<strong> Working Backwards</strong>.</p> <p>'Start with the customer and work backwards'&#8202;-&#8202;Jeff Bezos.</p> <p>Working Backwards is used to answer the following 5 questions:</p> <p>&#183; Who is your customer?</p> <p>&#183; What is the most important problem or opportunity?</p> <p>&#183; What is the most important customer benefit?</p> <p>&#183; How do you know what your customer needs or wants?</p> <p>&#183; What does the experience look like?</p> <p>The Working Backwards output is not a Powerpoint slide deck but rather a press release. Here are some guidelines for the press release:</p> <p>&#183; No more than 1 page.</p> <p>&#183; Language understandable to a 12-year-old.</p> <p>&#183; Testimonial expressing the 'Wow!' factor.</p> <p>&#183; Assume customers will only read the first paragraph.</p> <p>&#183; Leave more complex aspects for the FAQ.</p> <p>For more information on the Working Backwards methodology, I have written a complete blog on the topic that can be found <a href='https://www.ideastorm.co.za/single-post/2019/03/11/The-Working-Backwards-innovation-methodology'>here</a>.</p> <h3>3) How to do it?</h3> <p>The ' <strong>Flywheel Effect</strong> ' was a term created by Jim Collins in his book 'Good to Great'. A flywheel is a self-reinforcing loop made up of a few key initiatives. Those initiatives feed and are in turn driven by each other, and build a long-term business.</p> <p>Amazon uses the concept of the Flywheel and has taken it to the extreme. This is one of the key reasons for their success and accelerating revenues.</p> <p>Jeff Bezos spoke about how the success of Amazon.com has fueled the launch of Amazon Prime Video.</p> <blockquote>'Because we have this unusual way to monetize the premium content, we can charge less for the premium content than we would otherwise have to charge, if we didn't have the flywheel spinning to help sell more shoes'&#8202;-&#8202;Jeff Bezos.</blockquote> <p>I have written a comprehensive blog on the amazing Flywheel Effect that can be found <a href='https://medium.com/swlh/the-amazing-flywheel-effect-80a0a21a5ea7'>here</a>.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>I am absolutely sure that if you implement the results of these three questions into your business that it will accelerate its performance.</p> <p>The three questions are:</p> <p>Question 1: What to focus on?</p> <p>Answer: Focus on <strong>Customer Obsession </strong>and have it as your number one principle.</p> <p>Question 2: What to do?</p> <p>Answer: Work out what the customer wants using the <strong>Working Backwards</strong> methodology.</p> <p>Question 3: How to do it?</p> <p>Answer: Place your effort into activities that cause a <strong>Flywheel Effect</strong>.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed this article and that it makes an impact in your life and adds to the success of your business.</p> <p>I am always interested in your stories and thoughts which can be emailed to me at <a href='mailto:lancepeppler@gmail.com'>lancepeppler@gmail.com</a> or visit my website <a href='http://www.lancepeppler.com'>www.lancepeppler.com</a>.</p> <em>The views of this blog are my own and don't represent the views of the company I work for.</em> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"1\",\n        longTitle: 'Seed Round-How Much Money Should I Raise?',\n        shortTitle: 'Seed Round-How Much Money Should I Raise?',\n        img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*d35Gqkl0sY3OesTfys9W6A.jpeg',\n        data:`<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*d35Gqkl0sY3OesTfys9W6A.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Seed round financing refers to money raised in the earliest stages of running a startup and usually represents the initial capital raised by a company. It's financing that is literally going to 'plant the seeds' for your company's future growth. You might have a stellar business plan, a working prototype, and even a few paying customers, but guess what? You still need money to purchase equipment, hire full-time staff, and rent out an office. So how much should you raise?</p> <p>The easy answer, of course, is 'as much as you can.' Imagine how easy things would be if you could raise enough seed stage capital that you would never have to go back to investors again in order to ask for more money. In a best-case scenario, you should try to raise enough money so that you can take your company to profitability. But realistically, you are only looking to get enough runway for the next 12 to 18 months at which point, yes, you'll need to go back to investors and raise your Series A round.</p> <p>There are several benchmarks for how much seed round capital you should raise. Assuming you're a tech company bringing a new product to market, you should count on having a team of 5 engineers (or developers). As a rule of thumb, simply multiply this figure by $15,000 for every month of the runway you are trying to create for a company. Using a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, you can immediately see that a five-person Silicon Valley startup is usually looking to raise between $1 million and $1.5 million for an 18-month period. (This is just math: $15,000 x 5 x 18 = $1.35 million) If you're based in a more affordable tech hub, you might be able to play around these figures and realize that you need considerably less than $15,000 per month. But that's what a ballpark figure does&#8202;-&#8202;it puts you in the right ballpark.</p> <p>When all is said and done, the minimum amount to raise during a seed round stage is typical $500,000 (which works out to roughly enough to afford 3 employees for 12 months). For an amount less than that, you can probably just go back to friends, families, and the deep-pocketed angel investor who happens to live in your neighborhood. If you're looking to raise more than $1.5 million, you might need to revisit your business plan to see where you are going wrong. (You might need to adjust from your 'best case' scenario to your 'base case' scenario).</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*U0RSzKRrEsmJDKYdRBB9Cw.jpeg'> </figure> <p>One important point to keep in mind is that the seed round is no longer an equity round. In layman's terms, it means that you and your partners (who own 100 percent of the company) no longer need to give up an equity stake so early in the lifecycle of your company. In Silicon Valley, seed rounds are typically financed with convertible debt (or similar types of debt instruments that convert into equity at some later date). Your Series A round will be your equity round, so don't worry, there will be plenty of future opportunities to give away ownership in your company.</p> <p>Once you've raised your initial seed round, it's time to get down to the serious business of pushing your company one step closer to profitability. The better the financial condition of your company after a period of 12 months, the better terms you will be able to negotiate with VC investors later.</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"2\",\n        longTitle: 'The Two Things Entrepreneurs Should Do Every Day',\n        shortTitle: 'The Two Things Entrepreneurs Should Do Every Day',\n        img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*YINY3Atfk4BfkWak',\n        data:`<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*YINY3Atfk4BfkWak'> </figure> <p>The intersection between business and the arts is tricky to cross unless you're David Mamet.</p> <p>Early in his career, Mamet worked in real estate. He turned his experiences with cutthroat salespeople into the play <em>Glengarry Glen Ross.</em> This play and the subsequent film won multiple awards on Broadway and at the Oscars.</p> <p>Today, Mamet offers two rules for succeeding first as an artist and second as a business person.</p> <blockquote>He said, 'You've got to do one thing for your art every day, and you've got to do one thing for your business every day.'</blockquote> <h3>Focus On What Success Looks Like</h3> <p>As an entrepreneur, starting a business is one of the most creative acts you can undertake.</p> <p>An ability to create products, services and offers represents your craft, whereas the bottom line reflects the health of your business.</p> <p>When I first heard Mamet's advice, I pictured a bearded recluse hunched over his desk working by candlelight and etching out <em>War and Peace</em> with an fancy quill pen.</p> <p>That's not reality.

Failure hurts the ego, ruins and alters plans, and it at times, make us feel like we are not good enough.</p> <p>In my career and life, I have been plagued by failure and the notion of not being good enough.</p> <p>When I tell people about having over 20 companies, sometimes I fail to say that the majority of them actually failed, went out of business, or I had to close down prematurely for a variety of reasons.</p> <p>Society has made the notion of failure seem so damn negative but as we all know very well... this 'failure' thing is pretty fucking normal. Nobody is really 'always winning', it just doesn't happen&#8202;-&#8202;haaa</p> <p>Though, there are those that see 'failure' in a completely different manner.<br>This is actually a defining factor between those that are becoming masters of their destiny and those that will become victims of their history!</p> <p>How do you look at things that do not go as planned? Or at possible 'failures'?</p> <p>It is actually a simple choice, but ONLY simple once you become truly aware of the controllable difference... Something that most of our schooling systems have not consciously picked up and implemented just yet. <br>So, the ease of being able to tell the difference has not been so damn easy if your parents, teachers, friends, and even the television has been telling you to avoid failing at all costs.</p> <p>I mean common now, schooling has actually taught us to gain security in the safest way possible. Which at one point, job security once existed, but not in today's world! Not with how fast things are changing and evolving.<br>Sadly enough, this is an antiquated notion that is still being taught in many schools.</p> <p>The majority of the time, they have not been giving us the entire picture.

I would have never gone harder into my studies, looked deeper into situations, and really found great appreciation when things really did 'go well or as expected'.</p> <p>In this screenshot here stands a great example of what some may perceive as a 'failure'.</p> <p>This was one of our stores that we scaled up to $221k in the first 3 weeks of opening it up!

The exact same product, almost the exact revenue per time period, and very similar problems that we had.</p> <p>Within a couple of months, I believe they completely shut down operations with the bank holding on to their money.<br>But the difference here was that when they saw failure, we actually saw the learning lessons at the end of the tunnel. We continued to push forward, despite the defeat we were feeling during it all.</p> <p>PERSPECTIVE:</p> <p>We were losing money for weeks, in upwards of almost $1,000 a day, Paypal and Shopify were holding over $80k of our money due to extremely fast scaling and not fast enough shipping, I was literally working 18 hours a day to fix the issues that ensued, and we had a giant paid for shipment STUCK in China with no way of getting here in time for Christmas.</p> <p>Just trying to find the replacements orders was an absolute nightmare, the cost was now double, and I was going to sleep at 5 to 6AM, night after night talking to Chinese suppliers.</p> <p>We decided to offer all late customers their money back for tardiness and all kinds of bonuses if they were to just wait a little longer. Losing us quite a bit of money but helped us save face, partially at least.</p> <p>I honestly felt like quitting and going back to more agency work, to take on more clients that I wasn't even inspired about anymore, as boredom had previously started to ensue for me in that world...</p> <p>3 FEET FROM GOLD</p> <p>I tend to use this phrase quite often because it is not something that has happened to me once... but several times!</p> <p>It may have been seen as something that many cannot come back from... but we saw this mistake as a huge learning lesson for the future.</p> <p>Since this screenshot of failure about a year and a half ago... we have now done over 5 Million dollars in revenue in this one store alone!

How do you know if it has failed and you need to kill it?' I asked.</p> <blockquote>'The best teams set exit criteria' Nick Coster replied. Nick, the co-founder of <a href='https://brainmates.com.au/'>Brainmates</a>, one of Australia's top product manager trainers, went on to explain that the best teams he has worked with set their criteria upfront. What does success or failure for their new product or new product feature look like?</blockquote> <p>Let's unpack this statement because within it there is so much gold to be had. Let's understand why doing this is essential and also how you can implement it for your teams.</p> <h3>5 Types of Success Criteria for New Product</h3> <p>Setting your success criteria at the outset has a range of benefits. These are five things to consider:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Focuses everyone on what matters. </strong>Having a clearly defined criteria for what will lead to success will focus everyone on the most important activities that are needed in order to make the feature a success. It will help cut out all those activities that seem like they 'should' be done but really aren't necessary or aren't necessary right now, in order to gauge the success of your new feature.</li> <li> <strong>Avoid emotion perpetuating in a product or feature. </strong>One of the greatest drivers of poor decisions is emotion (just ask leading investors like Buffett or Howard Marks). You fall in love with the feature, you don't want the feature to fail because you fear job loss, you desperately want it to succeed to prove something to the world, you're greedy because some financial incentive is perceived to be there. Setting clear criteria as early as possible removes the emotion.</li> <li> <strong>Ensure what you're doing is achievable, useful, or valuable. </strong>Taking the time to determine your success or failure criteria at the outset usually, by its very nature, causes you to consider how the feature will be valuable to the business, be useful to customers and be achievable.</li> <li> <strong>Kill bad ideas ahead of time. </strong>Thinking about the criteria might lead you to kill the idea before you waste time and money on it. You may realize that, in order to be successful, the activities you need or the success criteria is unachievable or provides no value to the business.</li> <li> <strong>Alignment on expectations.</strong> You're most likely operating with a team, whether you're in a company with thousands of people working on product or you're in a startup. <a href='https://www.terem.com.au/expectations-new-product/'>Setting expectations at the outset for new products</a> has huge benefits that will help avoid arguments and difficulties further down the track, when things have or haven't gone as planned.</li> </ol> <p>Lastly, you wouldn't make an investment in stock or property without some kind of expectation of the return you want. So don't invest in your product without an idea of what the return will be.</p> <h3>7 Ways to Apply Success Criteria</h3> <p>Now that you understand the benefits of setting success criteria for new features and new products, you'll be looking at how to apply this. Here are some useful guidelines to use in order to get the most out of setting success criteria:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Choose only one metric.</strong> This makes it easier for teams to rally around, easier to understand, and easier to focus on the activities that are important (and not so important). The one caveat to choosing one metric is that you may need a counter-metric or two.</li> <li> <strong>Choose a metric as closely aligned as possible to both customer success and business success</strong>. It's OK to spend more time here than you think is needed to really ensure the metric you are choosing is as close to measuring whether a customer is getting value <em>and</em> the business is or will receive value. If you aren't addressing both then be careful, it may be that you're measuring a vanity metric or setting yourself up for a product feature that isn't going to move the needle.</li> <li> <strong>Make the metric specific to the feature/product you are creating.</strong> Personally, most of my mistakes have been from using general metrics where a more specific metric, specific to my exact product, would have better allowed me to set success criteria. For instance, <em>active users</em> is often touted as a way to set success criteria but if you haven't previously had clarity on what an active user means to your product then active users is just a vanity number.</li> <li> <strong>Change the metric if you need.</strong> If you discover that the metric you have chosen isn't the best one you could be using to judge success or failure, then change it. Just don't change it to make it easier to pass so you feel good.</li> <li> <strong>Make it a measure of people and their behavior.</strong> Usually products are about changing behavior in some way or taking action in some way for people. So the closer your metric is to people and their behavior the more likely it is a better measure of success.</li> <li> <strong>Write out what you will do for different results. </strong>For example, if 20 messages are sent with this new feature by each customer then it is a success. If only 5 messages are sent each week then it is a failure.</li> <li> <strong>Use a hypothesis if you don't have the data.</strong> Using a hypothesis driven approach will let you keep moving and keep things measurable. There are also more <a href='https://www.terem.com.au/benefits-hypothesis-driven-approach-new-product-development-large-organisations/'>benefits to a hypothesis-driven approach</a>.</li> </ol> <p>Now you know how and why to set success criteria for your new feature or product, so when you and your team are celebrating product success, you'll know it's for the right reasons.</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"5\",\n        longTitle: '7 Global Food Tech Trends to Watch in 2019',\n        shortTitle: '7 Global Food Tech Trends to Watch in 2019',\n        img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Eca0f0HVow9gim9L_nOQrw.jpeg',\n        data:`<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Eca0f0HVow9gim9L_nOQrw.jpeg'> </figure> <p>The global food market is blazing.

The reality of climate change and its global impact is fostering innovative startups eager to make change. With the rapid evolution of technology, digitalization opportunities&#8202;-&#8202;in a traditionally low-tech, complex industry- open a variety of applications to the global chain. An increase in desired wellness has also resulted in changes in consumer diets, facilitating the rise of vegetarianism and veganism. According to the Mintel Global Food and Drink Trends 2017 report, there was a<a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/30/trends-for-2017-show-wellness-and-foods-link-to-grow.html'> 257 percent increase in the number of vegan food and beverage launches in 2016</a>, compared to 5 years ago.</p> <p>The food and beverage industry is changing&#8202;-&#8202;that much is clear. Let's delve into 2019 food tech trends that are pulling us forward to more nutrition, more transparency, and increased utilization of technology.</p> <h3>Top Food Technology Trends Transforming Food and Agriculture</h3> <h4>1. Plant-based and Animal Free</h4> <p>Improved technologies focused on animal product substitutes continue to grow and get new investments. Wildfire tragedies in California and <a href='https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2806/prolonged-hot-dry-conditions-affect-european-crop-prices/'>reduction of crop yields in many European countries</a> brought even more focus to climate change, which is directly associated with animal farming and meat consumption due to high emissions of greenhouse gases. Impossible Foods recently launched the 2.0 version of its vegan burger, which was <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2019/01/11/the-new-impossible-burger-2-0-won-everyones-mouth-at-ces-2019-but-thats-just-the-beginning/#69b3370727c4'>the winner in the top tech category at CES 2019</a>. As prices decrease and sensorial quality increase, these products will gain more popularity among all consumer groups.</p> <h4>2. Service Robots and Restaurant Digitalization</h4> <p>Although expensive, food service robots will be making their way in 2019 as well as new e-restaurants such as <a href='https://www.spyce.com/'>Spyce</a> and <a href='https://www.eatsa.com/'>Eatsa</a>. By bringing together the convenience of ordering online, personalization of meals, access to healthy and nutritious ingredients, and the speed of getting food at a counter, service robots and e-restaurants are setting new standards. <a href='https://cafexapp.com/'>CafeX</a>'s robot arm is trained to prepare the perfect cappuccino and the <a href='https://caliburger.com/'>burger flipper robot</a> is a grilling master. What will be next?</p> <h4>3. Plastic Free</h4> <p>Last year was a turning point for the CPG space with many important changes in international regulations and the signature of agreements. We saw this with the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/world/europe/european-parliament-plastic-ban.html'>European Union banning the use of single-use plastics</a> such as straws, cutlery, plates, and stirrers. Suffering from high air-pollution rates, <a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/16/climate-change-china-bans-import-of-foreign-waste-to-stop-pollution.html'>China restricted importing and processing residues from other countries</a>. Furthermore, CPG giants, such as Danone and Coca-Cola, as well as important global generators of plastic waste, got together during <a href='https://ourocean2018.org/'>Our Ocean Global Conference</a> and signed an ambitious agreement to significantly reduce plastic generation and disposal. Biodegradable, plastic-free solutions with optimized functionalities are gaining traction. There are many corporations and startups leading the charge for packaging innovation. Check out <a href='https://www.rocketspace.com/corporate-innovation/topic/packaging-innovation'>my last article on packaging innovation</a> with a list of leading startups and corporations in the space.</p> <h4>4. Big Food, Transparency, and Common Values</h4> <p>The big food industry is still trying to figure out how to regain trust from customers, to be more aligned with their values, and to be more transparent. The boom of small brands and new e-commerce channels will continue to negatively impact the market share of the big players; in order to remain competitive, they must gain a better understanding of niche markets and the velocity to change gears. Traceability enablers, such as blockchain technology, will continue to expand and get new adopters in Food and Ag, as they enable fast data integration and identification of quality and origin of products. Interesting startups providing solutions include <a href='http://www.ripe.io/'>Ripe.io</a>, <a href='https://tefoodint.com/'>TE-FOOD</a>, and <a href='https://www.provenance.org/'>Provenance</a>.</p> <h4>5. Functional Beverage Boom</h4> <p>Low sugar, plant-based, functional beverages such as Kombucha, will continue to boom in 2019. <a href='https://www.bevindustry.com/articles/90063-kombucha-market-up-41-percent?v=preview'>The kombucha market, alone, increased nearly 41% to $534 million wholesale in 2017</a> and is expected to be worth <a href='https://www.fooddive.com/news/why-kombucha-sales-are-up-41/438398/'>$1.8 billion by 2020</a>. Howard Telford, Senior Beverage Analyst at Euromonitor International, commented on the current push for functional beverages into the meal space saying, <a href='https://www.fooddive.com/news/why-kombucha-sales-are-up-41/438398/'>'There's a shift toward consumers viewing beverages as a sort of preventative nutrition occasion. People are interested in functionality, and instead of asking 'What's in this bottle,' they're asking 'What is this bottle doing for me?'</a> High launch numbers in the pre and probiotic beverage and wellness drink space in 2018 highlighted how the convenience of drinking met the search for health and nutrition. New ingredients such as cannabis, mushrooms, MCT oil, new fibers, natural extracts, and pre/probiotics will continue to boost the creation of innovative, new beverages. Just take a look at <a href='https://www.remedyorganics.com/'>Remedy Organics</a>, <a href='https://whalebirdkombucha.com/'>Whalebird Kombucha</a>, and <a href='http://malkorganics.com/'>Malk Organics</a>.</p> <h4>6. Personalized and Special Diets</h4> <p>Digitalization and robotization increase the ability for personalization of food products, which is timely as demand is rapidly growing due to the spread of new diets and low-cost home-testing health diagnostics such as <a href='https://foodmarble.com/'>FoodMarble</a> and <a href='https://habit.com/'>Habit</a>. An increase in food allergies and intolerances worldwide will also give a boost to this trend. Solutions include meal plans such as <a href='https://www.platejoy.com/'>Platejoy</a>, which offers meal plans tailored to specific diets and cooking habits and integrates nutritional data with health tracking devices. Another example is <a href='https://sunbasket.com/'>Sunbasket</a>, a meal kit focused on special diets and organic ingredients. Full personalization of individual meals is still a challenge, but demand will push for innovations to continue in 2019.</p> <h4>7. Healthy E-food</h4> <p>Online food and e-commerce platforms will continue to grow and gain new adopters, as consumers continue to look for more convenient ways to shop.

This was the first study to show a mortality correlation. Other studies have shown increased chronic disease in individuals who prefer the midnight hours.</p> <p>But the conclusions drawn from this study may not be the correct interpretations. In fact, the author, Dr. Kristen Knutson, has suggested that there are many more factors that contribute to the findings other than simply sleep and that we should be careful making generic assumptions regarding the meaning of the findings.</p> <p>Too many research articles present findings that end up being misconstrued, taking the results literally rather than looking at other explanations.</p> <blockquote>While the objective findings represent increased death in individuals who like to stay up late, this does not mean that night owls should necessarily go to bed earlier.</blockquote> <p>In fact, there are a whole host of possible changes in our culture that could be beneficial for individuals and the companies for which they work.</p> <p>Thus, the conclusions drawn should be multifactorial and explore the many factors that could improve life for night owls. This could result in successes for employers as well.</p> <p>Imagine a world where night owls do their work into the late hours and then sleep in before going back to work. Yea, revolutionary, right? A bimodal work schedule, allowing flexibility for employees that like staying up late and, just perhaps, might be a time of increased productivity for those employees.</p> <p>Think about it&#8202;-&#8202;work from 11am-5pm, then go home, relax, and start working again around 10pm-1am. You get the same amount of hours in each day, but on your own flexible schedule, with a nice break in between.</p> <p>I'm not spitting out all opinion. When you look at other studies, there are some interesting findings.</p> <p><strong>#1</strong> Night owls may be more intelligent and creative than morning larks.</p> <p><strong>#2</strong> Adults who picked their own work schedule had increased productivity and job satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>#3</strong> Health could be related to how long you sleep rather than when you sleep.</p> <h4>Intelligence and Creativity</h4> <p>I'd hate to think that people who are night owls tend to have more brains than early risers. That's discrimination, right? However, one <a href='https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/12/eaau6200'>study</a> claimed improved grades for kids who were able to sleep in. Another <a href='http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/paid2009.pdf'>study</a> looked at adolescents with a later sleep schedule and found them to be more intelligent and creative than others who went to bed early.</p> <p>Let's not get ahead of ourselves. These studies were not the highest quality and allow for a significant number of confounding factors. But they provide an interesting perspective that should not be ignored.</p> <p>I am a night owl so I'd love to think I am more intelligent and creative than my counterparts. Unfortunately, logic tells me this is not the case. There has to be another reason why these studies showed a difference.</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, our society's norms do not allow the flexibility to stretch our creative minds. If we could dictate our own work schedules, would that change these findings?</p> <p>What may be most important is to figure out the ideal circumstances for each individual that will allow them to be the most focused and productive.</p> <p>If we tailor work time to worker, perhaps more creativity and innovation will follow. I'm certainly at the best of my ability when I'm not tired. I'd love to see what would happen if everyone worked at the top of their game.</p> <h4>Increased Productivity</h4> <p>When you make the decision to work, rather than being forced to follow a schedule, it would make sense that you'd be more productive and more satisfied. One <a href='https://www.gensler.com/research-insight/gensler-research-institute/the-2013-us-workplace-survey-1'>survey</a> found this to be true. Not only are employees satisfied with their own work, but they were also happier with their employers.</p> <p>I understand that there are necessary meetings or teamwork activities in every job. Why do these need to be in the beginning of the day? If an employee needs to be in the office, then time it for midday when there would be overlap between morning risers and night owls.</p> <p>Furthermore, work is not about quantity, but quality.</p> <blockquote>If you want to measure how well an employee is working, measure their productivity and innovation.</blockquote> <p>I'd bet that night owls have a number of great ideas and could increase efficiency around midnight, so why not let them work these hours if the output is excellent?</p> <p>Rethinking work hours could be the best thing a company ever did for their production.</p> <h4>Improved Health</h4> <p>I'm aware that the original study cited showed increased mortality, but I'm not convinced that it is because night owls stay up late. In fact, isn't it possible that staying up late while required to wake up early for work could cause the health problems noted? This causes decreased sleep time and multiple <a href='http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/need-sleep/whats-in-it-for-you/health'>studies</a> have shown that decreased sleep hours are associated with poor health.</p> <p>What if we did a study comparing people who go to bed early and wake up early to night owls that go to bed late and wake up late? And let's say that each of these groups gets the same amount of sleep hours.</p> <p>I can't claim to know the answer to this question. And we'd probably need to look at a longer term model to research this idea, as it would take a regular schedule over months or years to see health improvements from a change in sleep cycle. But I think it's worth considering.</p> <blockquote>If we can improve intelligence, creativity, productivity, and health with one solution by changing work hours, doesn't that seem like a win, win, win?</blockquote> </div>`\n},\n    {\n        slugName: \"1\",\n        longTitle: \"Managing High Blood Pressure: Let’s Change the Equation\",\n        shortTitle:\"Managing High Blood Pressure: Let’s Change the Equation\",\n        img:'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*G_Rzu5W1vmT-C7bVn5n31w.png',\n        data:`<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*G_Rzu5W1vmT-C7bVn5n31w.png'> </figure> <p>Nearly <a href='https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/05/01/more-than-100-million-americans-have-high-blood-pressure-aha-says'>half of all American adults</a> have high blood pressure (also known as hypertension), a chronic condition that puts strain on the heart, arteries, kidneys and brain and can lead to many serious threats to health, including heart disease and stroke&#8202;-&#8202;as well as the chance of having an untimely death. The good news is that in many cases, with careful management and lifestyle modifications, high blood pressure can be kept at healthier levels.</p> <p>May is <a href='https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/HBP-education-month'>National High Blood Pressure Education Month</a>, a good time to remember what causes high blood pressure, what the risks are, and how it can best be managed. When blood pressure is too high, the heart has to work harder than normal to get blood to all parts of the body, and there is also increased pressure on all of the blood vessels. Blood pressure readings that are regularly above <a href='https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/reading-the-new-blood-pressure-guidelines'>130/80</a> are considered high (stage 1 hypertension)&#8202;-&#8202;and unhealthy.</p> <p>Home care nurses at <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/how-we-can-help/private-care-services/'>Partners in Care</a>, where I work, and its affiliate, the <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/'>Visiting Nurse Service of New York</a>, often play a key role in making sure that patients and family caregivers understand and can manage their medical conditions, including high blood pressure, beyond the doctor's office. To manage hypertension, our nurse-led teams work with patients and caregivers to establish a plan of care at home, help them understand the risks and red flags, and make sure patients and their caregivers know the next steps to take should their condition worsen. Our Partners in Care home health aides are also trained to prepare healthy low-sodium meals that help lower high blood pressure.</p> <p>First, people need to make sure they have their blood pressure checked regularly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that some <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/features/undiagnosed-hypertension/index.htm'>13 million Americans</a> have hypertension but don't know it. The dangers of untreated hypertension are enormous: High blood pressure is implicated in almost half of all strokes (May is <a href='https://www.stroke.org/may-is-national-stroke-awareness-month/'>Stroke Awareness Month</a> as well), and is a leading factor contributing to a number of heart conditions.</p> <p>Some of the risk factors for high blood pressure are unavoidable. These include age&#8202;-&#8202;our blood vessels naturally stiffen over time&#8202;-&#8202;family history and genetics, gender, and ethnicity. High blood pressure is more common in African American adults than adults of other ethnicities, and statistics vary by gender. Before age 55, men are more likely than women to have high blood pressure. After 55, the situation is reversed, with women more likely than men to develop the condition.</p> <p>On the other hand, many of the risk factors for high blood pressure are tied to lifestyle&#8202;-&#8202;and this is where individuals who are at risk, along with the family members and friends who care for them, can make a great difference. Here are a few important things you can do to help reduce risk of hypertension in yourself or a loved one:</p> <strong>Say no to salt</strong> <p>As with most healthy diets, a nutrition plan for high blood pressure is rich in fruits and vegetables, low in saturated fats and&#8202;-&#8202;most especially&#8202;-&#8202;low in salt. Packaged foods such as canned soups and canned items in general are loaded with sodium, so be sure to read food labels to check the amount of sodium in packaged foods (in fact, you should avoid packaged foods completely whenever you can). Keeping a food journal is a simple way to hold yourself accountable to your healthy eating goals. Writing down the content on your food labels&#8202;-&#8202;such as salt or sugar content levels, or how many servings of fruits and vegetables you have each day&#8202;-&#8202;helps you see, manage and plan your diet more effectively.</p> <strong>Get yourself moving</strong> <p>Exercising is important in controlling blood pressure and preventing complications related to hypertension. In addition, getting regular exercise can help you reduce excessive body weight, which is another risk factor for high blood pressure. Just 15 to 30 minutes of light physical activity, three to five days a week, can help reduce your risk for stroke and heart disease. Once you get started, small steps can lead to big progress&#8202;-&#8202;so look for ways to build activity into your daily routine: If you live in the city, walk to the mailbox or the corner bodega every day, or get off one stop early and walk a few extra blocks if you ride the bus or subway. If you can't get outdoors, walk the halls of your apartment building. And if you live in the suburbs or out in a rural environment, try to walk rather than take the car when doing errands.</p> <strong>Mind your medications</strong> <p>If lifestyle changes don't adequately reduce your blood pressure, your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to improve your blood flow, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers. It is critically important to take the medication you are prescribed, how and when you are supposed to. It's been reported that nearly 3 out of 4 Americans do not always take their medication as directed. Let your doctor know if a medication disagrees with you&#8202;-&#8202;if you face side-effects such as dizziness or swelling&#8202;-&#8202;rather than just deciding to stop taking it. Also, you should always bring a list of all your medications to each doctor's appointment and have your physician update the list.</p> <strong>Stop (or at least reduce) smoking and drinking</strong> <p>Smoking raises blood pressure and can cause strokes&#8202;-&#8202;so try to cut back or, better still, stop smoking entirely. Limiting your alcohol consumption is important too, as alcohol can adversely affect some heart medications and is also linked to increased stroke risk. Each person is different, but moderation is crucial.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> The National Cancer Institute is one of many health organizations with a plan to <a href='https://smokefree.gov/'>help you quit smoking</a>.</p> <strong>Connect to care</strong> <p>It is especially important for those at high risk of hypertension to stay in communication with their physicians and to be aware of high blood pressure and related health risks. As always, it is important to consult your health provider before making significant changes in your diet or fitness routine.</p> <p>I still remember during Superstorm Sandy in late October/early November 2012, which stranded thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers, our corps of visiting nurses and other frontline caregivers racing around the city to visit homebound seniors who were unable to get their medicines. More often than not, these included hypertension medication&#8202;-&#8202;which isn't surprising, since about <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/high-blood-pressure-guide.pdf?pdf=high-blood-pressure-guide'>3 in 10 New Yorkers</a>, and <a href='https://www.vnsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/high-blood-pressure-guide.pdf?pdf=high-blood-pressure-guide'>62% of Americans age 65+&#8202;-&#8202;</a> have the condition.</p> <p>Fortunately, you can begin changing the equation today. Get your blood pressure checked regularly, and then follow up with these healthy steps towards better blood flow, and better health.</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"2\",\n        longTitle: \"We Are Paying to Be Poisoned!\",\n        shortTitle:\"We Are Paying to Be Poisoned!\",\n        img:'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/t/1200/360/1*8cANTZXhhDpll_uZtGOrIg.jpeg',\n        data: `<div> <p>At least we'll smell nice dead.</p> <blockquote>We are willing lab rats and anoint ourselves at the alter of big business alchemy.</blockquote> <p>Have you read the back of your antiperspirant? Are you concerned about the chemicals it contains or is ignorance bliss?</p> <p>Like most people, I'm conscious of what I eat and drink. I endeavor to ingest natural and healthy nutrition. I don't want to invite sickness, no body would. I like to keep my food chemical free.</p> <p>Why then do we persist in slathering questionable chemicals on our bodies to avoid body odor? Our skin is our biggest organ. It's porous and absorbs everything we put on it. It's a gateway to our internal functions.</p> <p>We've been conditioned to accept that even infinitesimal amounts of odor is publicly unacceptable. We trust multi-national manufacturers and rub their chemical concoctions on ourselves because no one wants to stink or be embarrassed by body odor. We are willing lab rats and anoint ourselves at the alter of big business alchemy.</p> <p>Why would we put any chemical on our bodies? Surely natural is better.</p> <p>It comes down to convenience and efficacy. Natural products often work less effectively, so we gamble on chemicals.</p> <p>I took an old antiperspirant of mine and looked at the contents. For years I sprayed this on my body. Here's some of the contents. (Some!)</p> <p>I'm not a scientist or researcher. This is purely my layman's interpretation on what is mass produced and sold to us on a world-wide scale. I make my own mind up.</p> <h3>1. Aluminium</h3> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ReT8SHIXC91VvRmwzC_DDg.jpeg'> </figure> <p>We're all exposed to aluminium. It could be through food or in vaccines. It's used in tin foil, soda cans and many other products. What about your underarm though? It gets dosed in antiperspirant daily, sometimes multiple times in a day. The aluminum is there to migrate to your sweat glands to prevent sweat coming out. It's like a plug.</p> <p>Sweating is one way for your body to remove toxins. When that is blocked they remain within your system. This aluminium also migrates to the blood stream.</p> <p>In 2016 Reading University in the United Kingdom released a <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997127'>study</a> which said spraying the underarm with antiperspirants containing aluminium adds additional exposure through the skin in the area of the upper outer quadrant of the breast. It also stated that this area of the breast has a 'disproportionately high incidence of breast cysts and breast cancer.'</p> <p>The study went on to say aluminium has a negative affect at a <em>cellular level</em> including the development of hallmarks associated with cancer.</p> <p>Here is the the most telling line from the study ' Aluminium has been shown to cause adverse alterations to the breast micro environment.'</p> <p>An earlier <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16045991'>study</a> by the same university (2005) said aluminium has a genotoxic profile that can alter DNA. Aluminium can interfere with oestrogen action and oestrogen is a well established influence in breast cancer.</p> <p>In 2008 Center Antoine-Lacassagne, Nice, France <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18829420'>concluded</a> there is no risk of breast cancer through the use of deodorant and antiperspirant.</p> <p>And therein lies the problem. Like most scientific studies, another study comes along and refutes the first and around and around we go. You have to decide based on your own interpretation and beliefs.</p> <p>I do not believe big pharmaceutical companies. For me, aluminium is a no-no. I don't want it in my body. Even if three quarters of the studies are incorrect, there are too many negatives in the remaining quarter.</p> <p>I'm also very aware that big business, multinational companies don't care about me.</p> <h3>2. Butane/Isobutane/Propane</h3> <p>According to the companies, these are used as a propellant and to assist with swift drying of the antiperspirant. No one wants to have sticky, wet armpits for ten minutes after application. They also cause that instant cooling feeling.</p> <p>Antiperspirants work by creating a very thin gel over the top of the sweat gland and the propellants enable the formation of this.</p> <p>The fact butane is derived from petroleum is enough to expel it from my life. There are <a href='https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb%3A%40term+%40DOCNO+944'>studies</a> that show inhalation of these propellants causes serious health effects or death.</p> <p>Inhaling the fumes directly to get high is a miserable thing to do. What about the millions of people around the world who apply their underarm in enclosed spaces like bathrooms and then spend the next ten minutes in there finishing their grooming? They do this every day.</p> <p>In a report from the United Kingdom a young teenager died after using excessive amounts of antiperspirant in a small space. <a href='https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/schoolgirl-12-died-inhaling-much-deodorant-used-like-going-fashion/'>'Analysis of brain samples revealed two substances present in aerosols&#8202;-&#8202;they are known as volatile substances. They are known to be present in deodorant which was present at the scene. Their presence is consistent with inhalation. Death may result from the toxicological effects. The substances are <strong>butane </strong>and <strong>isobutane</strong>'</a></p> <p>Given the origin of these chemicals and the likely side effects, I avoid them.</p> <h3>Cyclopentasiloxane</h3> <p>This is a silicon used as a delivery agent, lubricant and solvent. It is also anti-static. A <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_174.pdf'>study</a> from the Scientific Community on Community Safety (SCCS) said that when inhaled repeatedly (as you would do in an enclosed bathroom or bedroom) cyclopentasiloxane targets liver, lungs and uterus.</p> <p>The SCCS concluded that cyclopentasiloxane is safe at reported levels <em>in</em> hair styling aerosols and sun care spray products because the use of those products ' may lead to air concentrations above the value where SCCS considered it may be aerosolized and locally toxic'</p> <p>In other words, because you're spraying it in a manner that leaves particles in the air around your face and head, it's unacceptable. They say it is at acceptable levels in antiperspirant.</p> <p>Have you ever seen a teenage boy spray antiperspirant on himself in a bathroom? It's like a mist has descended and enveloped the entire room. It is all breathed in.</p> <h3>Sodium Benzoate</h3> <p>This is a man made chemical made by combining benzoic acid and sodium hydroxide. It is used as a preservative in foods and is found in soft drinks.</p> <p>You would consider this to be a safe chemical considering we consume it. It's found in tooth paste and mouthwash.</p> <p>It is used in industrial applications to deter corrosion in vehicle cooling systems, it's a stabilizer in photo processing and it is used to make plastic more durable.</p> <p>It can convert to benzene, a known carcinogen. Benzene has been found in soft drinks that contain sodium and vitamin c (abscorbic acid).</p> <p>It may cause <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229641'>inflammation</a>.</p> <p>A <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22538314'>study of college students</a> linked a high intake of beverages containing sodium benzoate to reports of ADHD. Although this study looked at the ingestion through soft drinks, this is sprayed on our porous skin!</p> <p>Many studies suggest sodium benzoate is fine in low doses. For me, anything that has an industrial application is going no where near my body!</p> <h3>Gelatin Crosspolymer ( hydrolyzed collagen)</h3> <p>Even the name sounds wrong. This is a skin conditioner and prevents the formation of bacteria. A quick bit of research on this ingredient for the antiperspirant I used for this provided me with a statement from the company.</p> <p>It stated that gelatin crosspolymer is used as a part of their technology that provides a boost of fragrance when you move and need it the most. It also stated it's derived from fish.</p> <ol> <li>If I buy a personal product, I don't necessarily want an animal to die so I can have nice smelling armpits.</li> <li>What chemical process do they put this collagen through to make it not smell like fish?</li> </ol> <h3>Silica</h3> <p>Silica is added to help absorb moisture when you sweat. If, like me, you get a rash on the armpit from antiperspirants, it may be the silica.</p> <p>Silica is also used in commercial products like cleansers, cosmetics, art clays and glazes, pet litter, talcum powder, caulk, putty, paint, and mortar.</p> <p>Yes, that chemical ingredient in your antiperspirant is also in paint, mortar, putty and caulk and is in those little absorbent bags in food product.</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"3\",\n        longTitle: \"Is Sitting The New Silent Killer?\",\n        shortTitle:\"Is Sitting The New Silent Killer?\",\n        img:'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/0*HWx6x-NN1QB9kvsf',\n        data: `<div> <p>And what you need to know about the Sit-Stand desks. </p> <p>As new technology is taking over the world, we rely more and more on the machines and lesser on doing things ourselves. Children don't go out to play in the parks anymore; instead, they spend their entire day sitting in one place, playing video games. Adults don't go out and meet people when they are 'bored', instead they spend the day binging on their favorite Netflix shows. Technology has made us lazy.</p> <p>With the progression of time, the jobs have changed too. The style of work is not the same it used to be 20 years back.

The key aspects of this research were to study the effects of these desks on the user's behavior, physiology, posture, work Performance, and any discomfort.</p> <p>The selected participants were followed for up to 1 year, after which it was concluded that the Sit-Stand desks were able to improve the discomfort and change their behaviors&#8202;-&#8202;they spent more time standing than before.</p> <p>However, it had very little effects on work performance, posture, and health. It could be explained by the fact that the Sit-Stand Desks allow you to stand in one place, without any mobility which is not any better than sitting.</p> <p>Hence it was concluded that the way to reduce the harmful effects associated with prolonged sitting was NEAT which stands for Non-Exercise Thermogenesis.</p> <h3>What is NEAT?</h3> <p>'Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is the energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise. It includes the energy expended walking to work, performing yard work, undertaking agricultural tasks, and fidgeting'</p> <p>In easy words, the way to practice NEAT includes taking a break from work every few minutes and walking around, even if it is to the water cooler.</p> <p>According to Dr. Diaz, who is a professor at Columbia University: 'If you have a job or lifestyle that involves a lot of sitting, you can lower your risk of early death by moving more often, for as long as you want and as your ability allows&#8202;-&#8202;whether that means taking an hour-long high-intensity spin class or choosing lower-intensity activities, like walking,'.</p> <p>In his study, almost 8,000 people who were 45 years or older were selected and were asked to replace only 30 minutes of their sitting time with any low-intensity physical activity of their choice-like walking. It was found that by doing this, they were able to lower the risk of mortality by 17%.</p> <h4>The key here is that physical activity of any form is able to provide health benefits.</h4> <p>Anything that interrupts the continuous cycle of Sedimentary activity or breaks up the long hours of sitting and gets you up from your seat is enough<strong>.</strong></p> <h3>So let's make a promise to ourselves today.</h3> <p>With all the diseases and negativity in the world, let's make a promise today to prevent the preventable and prioritize our health over everything else.</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"4\",\n        longTitle: \"The Rule Of Halves\",\n        shortTitle:\"The Rule Of Halves\",\n        img:'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/t/1200/360/1*dmkDkDzAp6A_bxQXK6AmvA.jpeg',\n        data: `<div> <p>Why we don't really know how big our health problems are </p> <p>Here's a question that most people think is pretty simple to answer: how many people have diabetes*? It seems simple because we all assume that things like disease statistics are collected routinely by our governments. The number of people who have a disease is an incredibly important thing to know&#8202;-&#8202;without it, you can't plan for the future, or even provide care today.</p> <p>It's surprising how lost we are without some basic statistics.</p> <p>Which makes it a shock when you realize that we actually don't really have a good number for diabetes, something that's true for a <a href='https://academic.oup.com/fampra/article/16/2/123/480177'>large number</a> of chronic health issues. If we look at diabetes, we can take country estimates&#8202;-&#8202;in the US, that's <a href='https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/DiabetesAtlas.html'>about 9%</a> of the population, while in Australia we think it's <a href='https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/diabetes/diabetes-snapshot/contents/how-many-australians-have-diabetes'>closer to 6%</a>&#8202;-&#8202;but the problem is that we know that these estimates <a href='https://static.diabetesaustralia.com.au/s/fileassets/diabetes-australia/e7282521-472b-4313-b18e-be84c3d5d907.pdf'>are flawed</a>.</p> <p>Partially that's because of the limitations of our monitoring systems, but a bigger part is that a lot of people are living out there, undiagnosed, with chronic diseases.</p> <p>Let me introduce you to the rule of halves.</p> <h4>Halving Health</h4> <p>The rule of halves was originally established when scientists in the 1970s were looking at people with <a href='https://www.bmj.com/content/300/6730/981'>high blood pressure</a>. They noticed an astonishing thing: while many people had high blood pressure, only half of them had been diagnosed by their doctor. If you just relied on the official figures&#8202;-&#8202;based on people self-reporting whether a doctor had diagnosed them&#8202;-&#8202;you'd underestimate the rate of high blood pressure by an enormous amount.</p> <p>Even scarier, they found that, while 50% of people were being diagnosed with high blood pressure, only half of THOSE people were being treated for the disease. So of the total population who had the problem, only 25% were being treated. Scarier still, only half of that small subgroup were getting to their targets, which means that of all the people with the disease, only a small fraction were being treated appropriately.</p> <p>It was a pretty terrifying finding.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QtxltwpYwjde5E--8FhQ_A.jpeg'> </figure> <p>And in the decades that followed, scientists found the same thing again and again: <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1371996/?page=1'>about half</a> of all people with high blood pressure&#8202;-&#8202;and a <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1371996/?page=1'>range of other chronic diseases</a> &#8202;-&#8202;remain undiagnosed. Of those who do get diagnosed, half are treated. Of those treated, half are treated effectively.</p> <p>Now, it's important to note that this is not true for ALL chronic diseases. Problems like <a href='https://www.copdfoundation.org/What-is-COPD/Understanding-COPD/What-is-COPD.aspx'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>, where people have very severe symptoms and almost always seek help, are usually diagnosed at much higher rates. But when you've got diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure, where the symptoms are often easy to live with until they're not, it's a recipe for a huge undiagnosed population.</p> <h4>What Do We Do?</h4> <p>This brings us to an important question: what can we do about the problem? We know that a lot of people are living undiagnosed with chronic health issues&#8202;-&#8202;for diabetes, the World Health Organization estimates it's <a href='https://www.who.int/diabetes/global-report/en/'>at least 20%</a> of all people with the disease&#8202;-&#8202;but it seems like a hard problem to solve.</p> <p>Well, the first thing is something that my team and I are working on, which is improving our detection of diabetes. In 2014, we knew there was a problem, with many people walking into the hospital had no idea that they were sick, so we <a href='https://drc.bmj.com/content/4/1/e000191?utm_source=trendmd&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=alljjs&amp;utm_content=americas&amp;utm_term=1-B'>conducted a pilot testing program</a> to see just how big that number was.</p> <p>It turned out that 30% of all the people with diabetes in our hospital had no idea that they had the disease.</p> <p>So, in 2016, we made this type of testing routine. We aren't screening the whole population, because we know from the literature that this isn't an effective/cost-effective way to go about it, but we test high-risk people to make sure we catch as many of them as possible.</p> <p>After two years of this testing, we found consistently that 17% of all people attending our hospital tested positive for diabetes, but fewer and fewer were undiagnosed.</p> <p>So far, so good.</p> <p>But hospitals aren't a great proxy for the community&#8202;-&#8202;mostly quite sick people go to hospitals, and we wanted to know if this situation was outside of our ivory tower. So we decided to do the same kind of testing, but in general practice clinics, where the patients were much more like your average person on the street.</p> <p>Much to our surprise, we found the exact same results as that initial hospital testing. 17% diabetes, many people completely unaware they had the disease. The paper is <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822718318862'>here if you want to read it</a>.</p> <p>What does all this mean? Well, firstly, that we haven't solved the problem. There are still a lot of people out there living undiagnosed with chronic disease. Even worse, health equity is a huge issue in who gets diagnosed and treated, with people who are at a higher risk of social disadvantage&#8202;-&#8202;for example, because of low income or inability to speak the country's language&#8202;-&#8202;seeing much higher rates of undiagnosed disease.</p> <p>But there is a ray of hope&#8202;-&#8202; <a href='https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/11/e023211'>a Danish study</a> found that, although many people with diabetes don't get diagnosed, if they are diagnosed they are usually treated, and often achieve their targets. Over 90% of diagnosed people were treated, and 40-60% of those were treated effectively.</p> <p>Lots of people are sick, but we can fix that.</p> <p>Ultimately, it seems like the rule of halves is still an issue, but it might not be for very long. We've shown that you can increase the number of people who are aware of their disease pretty easily&#8202;-&#8202;the tests are often quite cheap&#8202;-&#8202;and we also know that this will probably make a huge difference to their health long-term. Even more, fixing this problem will probably help make our health more equitable, but reducing the impact of missed diagnoses in for the most vulnerable people in our society.</p> <p>The first step to solving any problem is knowing how big the problem is.</p> <p>The next step is doing something about it.</p> <p>* <em>Note: In this article I'm mostly talking about type 2 diabetes, rather than type 1, gestational, or medication-induced/other diabetes. Type 2 diabetes makes up 95% of all diabetes, so while it is important to remember that it is not the only issue, it makes up the majority of undiagnosed/underdiagnosed cases.</em></p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"5\",\n        longTitle: \"Earbuds Raise Your Risk of Hearing Loss\",\n        shortTitle:\"Earbuds Raise Your Risk of Hearing Loss\",\n        img:'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/t/1200/360/1*f16NLbo4lYWsBEdu0eEZ9w.jpeg',\n        data:`<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*f16NLbo4lYWsBEdu0eEZ9w.jpeg'> </figure> <p>We see them everywhere. They're in restaurants, coffee shops, bookstores, department stores, and city parks&#8202;-&#8202;kids staring down, lost in their cell phones or other electronic gadgets, with earbuds jammed in their ears, completely oblivious to the world around them.</p> <p>Many times, the music they're playing on their phone is so loud, an observer can hear it from several feet away.</p> <p>While much research has examined how the overuse of technology affects children's brain development, a new concern is arising regarding the risks children face for premature hearing loss-particularly when using earbuds.</p> <h3><strong>All-Day Audio</strong></h3> <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the dawn of the MP3 player back in 2001, 13% of American children between ages 6 and 19 have acquired some level of noise-induced hearing loss.</p> <p>That's more than 5 million young people.</p> <p>According to audiologists, today, <a href='http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/generation-deaf-doctors-warn-dangers-ear-buds-n360041'>hearing loss in teens is about 30% higher</a> now now than it was in the 1980s and 1990s. Though teens have always gone to rock concerts, which pose a great threat of premature hearing loss, the significant increase in hearing loss among today's generation of younger people is being attributed to the daily use of earbuds.</p> <p>Twenty-five years ago, people used their Sony Walkman Personal Stereos for about half an hour per day, either while jogging, working out, or doing some other short-term activity.</p> <blockquote>When the activity was finished, so was their listening time.</blockquote> <p>They were also using headphones that went over the ears. Back then, it wasn't as common to turn the volume up too high because the simpler technology meant the sound would become distorted. At the same time, these devices ran on two AA carbon batteries with limited lifespans, so using them for hours on end wasn't an option.</p> <p>Today, cell phones and MP3 players can last for years and have batteries that are rechargeable. Kids can listen to music or watch videos for hours on end while using earbuds that are inserted into the ear canal, often just a half inch from the eardrum.</p> <p>The digital technology makes sound crystal clear, so there is no real incentive to keep it low. In fact, kids have a strong tendency to turn the volume up to drown out exterior noise from things like crowds and traffic.</p> <p>With earbuds being so close to the hearing mechanism inside the ear, the risk of hearing damage occurring at lower levels is very real.</p> <p>Simply because they place the source of sound closer to the eardrum, earbuds have been shown to increase volume by 9 decibels when compared to other hearing appliances.</p> <blockquote>Based on the increase in patients audiologists are seeing, it's been estimated that anywhere between <a href='http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9797364'>15% and 25% of children</a> listen to their devices at hazardous levels.</blockquote> <h3><strong>How Hearing Happens</strong></h3> <p>The cochlea or small snail-shaped inner ear chamber is where hearing happens. It's lined with 16,000 tiny hair cells that vibrate at different frequencies. It's those vibrations that get translated into nerve signals and sound perceptions.</p> <p>We know that loud noise damages and even kills these fragile hair cells, and once gone, they never regenerate. Hearing loss is cumulative over a lifetime, and any amount of hearing loss is irreversible. Because it comes on gradually, many people don't notice it until they're in their 40s or 50s, often experiencing the kind of hearing loss that isn't normally seen until the 70's.</p> <p>New research from Harvard Medical School's Eaton Peabody Laboratory is now showing that the nerve synapses in the inner ear are more vulnerable to damage than the hair cells themselves.</p> <p>A series of experiments with young animals showed that even a single exposure to loud noise accelerates hearing loss later in life. This is mostly due to damage done to nerve synapses. In fact, a person can lose up to 90% of their cochlear hair cells and still be able to detect a tone in a quiet room. However, once background noise is introduced, hearing ability drops dramatically.</p> <p>So while a person's hair cells may be largely intact, they can still experience hearing loss if <a href='http://www.newswise.com/articles/noise-induced-hidden-hearing-loss-mechanism-discovered'>the nerve synapses are damaged</a>.</p> <p>When a nerve fiber is damaged, it never reconnects or responds to sounds. Within a few months or years, the neuron itself shrivels and disappears. Earbuds are of particular concern because they deliver stronger, more damaging sound waves straight to the cochlea, even at lower volumes.</p> <p>Typical signs of hearing loss include ringing, roaring, hissing or buzzing sounds in the ear, difficulty understanding speech in noisy places or locations with poor acoustics, muffled sounds or a feeling of fullness in the ear, and listening to radio or TV at higher levels than in the past. Anyone experiencing these kinds of symptoms should be examined by a professional.</p> <h3><strong>How Loud is Too Loud?</strong></h3> <p>According to the National Institutes of Health, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or <a href='http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/06/11/avoid-hearing-loss-check-decibels-before-entering-room.html'>above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss</a>. To put this into perspective, normal speech registers at about 60 decibels.</p> <p>City traffic can reach 85 decibels, as does the volume in movie theaters, although it has peaks that are much higher.</p> <p>A lawnmower registers at 90 decibels, a chainsaw at 100, and a rock concert or stadium noise range from 110-120. Most MP3 players today can produce volumes up to 120 decibels. At that level, permanent hearing loss can occur in as little as 8 minutes. The louder the noise, the shorter amount of exposure is required to create permanent hearing loss.</p> <p>Anything under 75 decibels is considered healthy. By contrast, a noisy lunchroom full of screaming middle-schoolers averages about 89 decibels. There's a reason why teachers keep telling children to quiet down during lunchtime, and it's not because they're boring adults who don't know how to have fun!</p> <p>And here's something important to note: This is about the same level of noise an MP3 player produces at just 70% of volume.</p> <h3><strong>Setting Healthy Levels</strong></h3> <p>The most effective way to preserve hearing is to stop using earbuds completely because they place sound too close to the inner ear. Stop using headphones, as well. If you must use headphones, choose the highest quality you can find and be sure they fit completely over the ear, so there is little temptation to turn up the volume.</p> <blockquote>If someone can hear 'leakage' from your headphones from several feet away, the volume is too loud.</blockquote> <p>Likewise, if you can't hear anything going on in the environment around you with your headphones on, the sound level is too high.</p> <p>Many cell phones and MP3 players can lock sound at lower levels. This can be a great tool to train yourself to get accustomed to lower levels and prevent children from getting into the habit of turning the volume up all the time.</p> <p>Regardless of where you are or what you're doing, the general sound rule is that if you have to raise your voice to be heard, it's too loud.</p> <p>When using headphones, most doctors and audiologists recommend following the 60/60 rule.</p> <blockquote>Headphone usage should be limited to 60 minutes per day at 60% of the maximum volume or less.</blockquote> <p>Just by making these simple changes, you'll be able to preserve your hearing your child's for a lifetime.</p> <h4>For more health and inspirational insights from Dr. Sadeghi, please visit <a href='https://behiveofhealing.com/'>Behiveofhealing.com</a> to sign up for the monthly newsletter, check out his annual health and well-being journal, <a href='https://beingclarity.com/product/megazen-well-being-journal-volume-6/'>MegaZEN</a>, or for messages of encouragement and humor, follow him on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/beingclaritynow/'>Instagram</a>and<a href='https://twitter.com/beingclaritynow'> Twitter </a>@beingclaritynow.</h4> </div>`\n    }\n];\nexport default articlesHealth;","import React from 'react';\nimport articlesHealth from \"../../Data/Health\";\nimport styled from \"@emotion/styled\";\nimport { HashRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport {CardArticle} from \"../CardArticle/CardArticle\";\n\nconst StyledWraper = styled.div`\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-wrap: wrap;\njustify-content: space-around;\n`;\nconst StyledHeader = styled.h1`\ntext-align: center;\ncolor: #373A47;\nfont-size: 1.5rem;\n`;\n\nexport function Health() {\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <StyledHeader>Health</StyledHeader>\n            <HashRouter>\n                <StyledWraper>\n\n                    {articlesHealth.map((item, i) =>    <CardArticle item ={item}/>)}\n                </StyledWraper>\n            </HashRouter>\n        </>\n    );\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","import React from 'react';\n\nexport function Home() {\n    return (\n        <h1>Home</h1>\n    );\n};\n","const articlesFood = [\n    {\n        slugName: \"0\",\n    longTitle: \"Can Music Really Affect Your Food Choices?\",\n    shortTitle: \"Can Music Really Affect Your Food Choices?\",\n    img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/t/1200/360/0*_J-J85J_wNPDdRXf',\n    data: `<div> <h2>Is there a relationship between Music and Food?</h2> <strong>What kind of Food do you prefer?</strong> <p>All of us are Joey Tribbianis' at heart, whether we learn to control our impulses and manage our diets or have standard two pizzas every Friday, we all love food. However, if someone were to ask me what kind of food I prefer, I'd say it varies every day, depending on the mood. Somedays I'd go for proper Chinese food, while the others I would just order some bigger-than-my-mouth, good Ol' Burger, dripping in mozzarella.</p> <strong>What kind of Music do you prefer?</strong> <p>Whether it is rock, pop, jazz- we all have our preferences. For instance, during parties, I usually prefer loud, upbeat music that I could dance to, but when I am home all alone, I secretly like to listen to the old classics(Can't help falling in love by Elvis Presley- still my favorite!).</p> <h4>Music and Mood</h4> <p>Music holds the ability to change our mood within seconds. Listening to slow songs takes us down the memory lane, helps us reminisce, remember old friends, conversations and important moments from our life making us nostalgic. Meanwhile listening to a more upbeat song recharges us, helping some people focus while making the others want to dance.</p> <h4>Mood and Food</h4> <p>Stress-eating is a thing. The relationship between our mood and the type of food we eat is a much-discussed topic. Whether it is an important exam, or a difficult decision or even a breakup, we eat. From finishing buckets and buckets of ice cream to filling ourselves with all kinds of junk food, we binge on unhealthy food like anybody's business when we are stressed.</p> <h4>So the question is, How exactly does music affect your food choice?</h4> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1Yp3zJuxA8TvVFssLfj-Ew.jpeg'> </figure> <p>In a recent group of <a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-018-0583-8'>studies</a>, published in the Journal of Academy of Marketing Science, Dipayan Biswas investigated the 'Effects of ambient music and background noise on food sales'.</p> <p>With the multiplying chains of restaurants and new places opening every day, the competition in the Food industry is crazy. New restaurants are going to lengths to increase their sales and establish their name in the market. While the food remains the same more or less, these restaurants are enhancing their ambiance to attract customers.</p> <p>In this research, Biswas studied the effects of ambient music on the food choices customers make. But how does music set the 'ambiance'? It depends on the volume at which it is set and the genre of the music.</p> <h4>Volume:</h4> <p>It is a long used marketing strategy by numerous outlets, where they use the volume of the music to select the age group of potential customers. For example, what kind of music comes to your mind when you think of a chic cafe or a burger place filled with high schoolers? Nothing except loud, upbeat music- The newest hits.</p> <p>Whereas you'd see the opposite atmosphere if you go for a 'fine dine'. The music is definitely mellow and the customers are mostly adults.</p> <p>In one of the studies, a cafe was randomly chosen, located in a quiet neighborhood. Two days were selected to test out the hypothesis. On Wednesdays, only mellow, softer songs were played whereas on Fridays considerably louder music was played. At the end of the chosen time frame, it was found almost 43% of healthy food was ordered on Wednesdays(low volume) and while only 32.49% of healthy food was sold on Fridays(High volume).</p> <h4>Genre:</h4> <p>In another study by Biswas, he chose a number of college students to test out the effect of different music genres on the food choices. To substitute as 'loud music' a series of heavy metal rock music was used and students were asked to choose from chocolate and granola bars. The results showed that during the heavy metal rock, only 52.57% chose granola bars as compared to 92% for the alternate.</p> <p>He explained the results by saying: 'The findings of our research suggest that relaxation that stems from low volume music leads to [an] increased preference for healthy foods.'</p> <strong>Loud Music and Stress-Eating:</strong> <p>Loud music/ background noise can be a lot sometimes. It can make you uncomfortable, it can stress you out and can seem to get on your nerves. This stress causes your body to crave all kinds of unhealthy foods. and that's how you start stress eating.</p> <p>'Not surprisingly, chronic dieters and restrained eaters are especially sensitive to the effects of stress. Excitement/stress lead individuals to choose unhealthy foods mainly because sweet and fatty foods help reduce high levels of excitement and stress. In fact, research with both humans and animals suggests that unhealthy/comfort foods can alleviate physiological stress responses.'</p> <strong>Slow Music and Relaxation:</strong> <p>The opposite effect is shown by playing slow, meditative music, as shown in a <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/'>study</a>, by L. Bernardi and co-authors where they carried out measured the cardiovascular and respiratory changes in a patient as he listened to music.</p> <p>They concluded their research by explaining the effects of music.</p> <p>' Music induces an arousal effect, predominantly related to the tempo. Slow or meditative music can induce a relaxing effect; relaxation is particularly evident during a pause. Music, especially in trained subjects, may first concentrate attention during faster rhythms, then induce relaxation during pauses or slower rhythms.'</p> <p>Hence the more relaxed you are, the better choices you make.</p> <h4>Reference:</h4> <ol> <li> <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11747'>Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</a>. <a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-018-0583-8?fbclid=IwAR3suNxaXhXemzaT9txQaTxOaU7eTDjvkxAG_ampBy5i5fa0xLa-BZqbF4g'>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-018-0583-8?fbclid=IwAR3suNxaXhXemzaT9txQaTxOaU7eTDjvkxAG_ampBy5i5fa0xLa-BZqbF4g</a> </li> <li> <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/'>Heart</a>. 2006 Apr; 92(4): 445-452. <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846</a> </li> </ol> </div>`\n},\n    {\n        slugName: \"1\",\n        longTitle: \"Does coconut oil burn fat?\",\n        shortTitle: \"Does coconut oil burn fat?\",\n        img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0lZa5M4IOJ0vNI5AGT52qQ.jpeg',\n        data: `<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0lZa5M4IOJ0vNI5AGT52qQ.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Look 'coconut oil' up online, and you'll find a myriad of suggested uses, from adding coconut oil to your daily smoothie to eating it straight from the jar.

The researchers thought that this might be because they appeared to burn fat at a higher rate.</p> <p>'But not so fast,' says <a href='https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/vanessa-imus'>Vanessa Imus</a>, a registered dietitian at the Weight Loss Management Center at University of Washington Medical Center-Roosevelt.</p> <h3>The fat that makes you thin</h3> <p>There are holes that can be punched into the eating-coconut-fat-can-make-you-thin premise. Participants in that 2003 study were fed medium-chain triglycerides&#8202;-&#8202;something found neither in nature nor on the grocery store shelf. (' <a href='https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/228994'>Medium-chain</a> ' refers to the number of carbon atoms that comprise the tail or 'chain' of the fatty acid.)</p> <p>And results of a related study with women showed some increase in fat burning and energy expenditure but <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/0802169'>no change in body composition</a>.</p> <p>'There are some studies that suggest coconut oil has a better metabolic effect and others that show no difference. The research is still split,' says Imus.</p> <p>There's a long history of supposed fat-burners like grapefruit or apple cider vinegar that didn't pan out in long-term studies; there are as of yet no such long-term studies on coconut oil.</p> <p>The jury may still be out, but that hasn't stopped bloggers from milking the coconut oil trend for all it's worth.</p> <h3>The eating habits that make you healthy</h3> <p>'People hear about something like this and go out and buy all these pills and supplements and they're adding to what is already in their diet instead of just replacing it,' says Imus.</p> <p>What she recommends instead is eating for the long haul. That means eating a balanced diet of unprocessed whole foods, including a variety of high-fiber vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds and lean proteins.</p> <p>'Coconut oil has high levels of calories and saturated fat and it's never a good idea to overdo those. You don't want to add more saturated fat to what is already in your diet,' says Imus.</p> <p>But she does have a few tips on how you can integrate coconut oil into your diet in a nutritionally sound way.</p> <p><strong>Replace some of your existing saturated fat consumption with coconut oil</strong>. Coconut oil is a good replacement for butter or shortening. Use it to grease your muffin pans, put on your toast or roast your vegetables.</p> <p><strong>Use coconut oil to cook at high heats</strong>. Coconut oil can add a nice flavor to a stir fry and holds up well in high heat cooking. It doesn't oxidize like a lot of other oils will at high temperatures.</p> <p><strong>Choose unrefined coconut oil, sometimes also called 'virgin' or 'pure.'</strong> Like it sounds, unrefined coconut oil has no additives and is extracted from fresh coconuts. So if you do decide to go coconut, go unrefined.</p> <p>But when it comes to trying to use coconut oil to lose weight, meet with your local dietitian for healthier, more sustainable ideas, says Imus.</p> <p>'Think of coconut oil like you would a butter,' says Imus. 'You're probably not going to eat a stick of butter every morning with the idea that it will help you burn fat.'</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"2\",\n        longTitle: \"The secret $1 billion beef jerky battle\",\n        shortTitle: \"The secret $1 billion beef jerky battle\",\n        img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9lWsIauNsyeChocpAVeRJA.jpeg',\n        data: `<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9lWsIauNsyeChocpAVeRJA.jpeg'> </figure> <p>The modern history of beef jerky in America is surprisingly brief&#8202;-&#8202;although its origins are older than the country itself.</p> <p>The original technique for jerky migrated north from South America in the 16th century, around the same time the first cows did.</p> <p>It wasn't long until that technique, <em>Ch'arki</em>, was Anglicised and bastardized into <em>jerky</em>. But America's acceptance of the dried beef was far from emphatic.</p> <p>In fact, the wholesale aversion to preserved meat is what created the 19th centuries largest American industry and its greatest American hero in the form of cattle drives and cowboys.</p> <p>So when exactly did Americans convert to the now ubiquitous cult of beef jerky?</p> <h3>The jerky we know and love</h3> <p>The answer, surprisingly, is 1986.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*y5jws6mhtER6r7V0'> </figure> <p>Jack Link's, the company started by Wisconsin's John 'Jack' Link, is almost single handedly responsible for the existence of the billion dollar meat snack industry.</p> <p>Link slowly grew the company by attending trade shows and getting placements in convenience stores until their distribution eventually mirrored the map of America.</p> <p>The approached worked incredibly well. Today, aside from being ubiquitous, the company makes upwards of $300 million a year and command more than 50% of the meat snack market share.</p> <p>While Jack Link's still makes quadruple the amount of its nearest competitor, the fact that competitors exist <em>at all</em> is a relatively recent development in the industry.</p> <p>The company's first competitor, Krave, only showed up in 2010. And less than 5 years later it was acquired by Hershey (in their first non-chocolate purchase). Now, the industry is overrun by seemingly 'artisanal' brands that are actually backed by massive consumer packaged goods conglomerates (EPIC Provisions, a brand popular in health food stores like Whole Foods, is owned by General Mills).</p> <p>The jerky land grab is fuelled by the industry trend towards 'better for you' meat protein products. The rise of general health consciousness, coupled with protein-heavy diets like Keto and Paleo, has guaranteed the success of any brand promoting itself as healthier, more protein packed, or containing less sugar.</p> <p>And this trend has opened the door for one particular protein snack that has, until now, been waiting patiently in the wings for its chance to penetrate the American market.</p> <h3>Still beef. Not jerky.</h3> <p>If you walk in to any specialty health food store today, you'll be hard pressed to find the kind of beef jerky that Jack Link's, EPIC, and others have had so much success peddling. In fact, in many cases, you'd be hard pressed to find beef jerky at all.</p> <p>The shelves are dominated by something new. Something called Biltong.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Kim-atfYPqyr5ffxB2RaEg.jpeg'> </figure> <p>To call biltong <em>new</em> is a misnomer. Biltong, in its current form, has existed since at least 1835, but its only now beginning to make the migration across the Atlantic.</p> <p>Biltong is a traditional South African food that comes from the <em>Afrikaans</em> words bil (meaning buttock) and tong (meaning strip). It's made with little more than salt and pepper, and is hung to air dry instead of being cooked at low temperatures like jerky is.</p> <p>Until very recently, Biltong has struggled to break into the North American market. Not because of how similar it is to jerky, but because of how different it is.</p> <h3>Tasting the difference</h3> <p>Like anything else that originates from outside America, biltong has had an existential crisis of sorts trying to market itself in America: do you try educate Americans on why biltong is better? Or do you just market yourself as another kind of jerky?</p> <p>The dilemma is hard to imagine for those who haven't tasted it.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*UAO9D3Ye0IYUi83LixEavg.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Biltong has been described in many ways, but the most accurate are probably 'like a cross between beef jerky and prosciutto' and 'like thin slices of steak'. Because of the way that it's prepared, biltong has a striking resemblance in taste to meat you would consume in your every day life. It tastes, more or less, like a rare steak.</p> <p>Wouldn't Americans rather eat portable steak than sugar-coated-meat-candy?</p> <p>That's the question American biltong makers have been losing sleep over for the last decade or so. Biltong's growth has actually been stunted by its comparisons to beef jerky. Because 'beef jerky without sugar' has been an awfully unappetizing (and inaccurate) description until the advent of the millennial health re-awakening.</p> <p>Like comparing miso and minestrone. Only using beef jerky as the most common ground between the two&#8202;-&#8202;a necessity because American culture is dominated by fast food rather than easy accessible, high quality, snack-able food.</p> <h3>The future of beef</h3> <p>As the market trends towards better, fewer, ingredients biltong has found a natural niche that jerky can't compete with. As consumers become more discerning, the chasm between 'less-sugar' jerky and zero sugar biltong will only widen.</p> <p>The jerky industry has spent so long prioritizing accessibility over quality and health that they are likely going to have a hard time scrambling to pivot from an industry built on selling to ' <a href='https://www.nosh.com/news/2018/beyond-bubba-better-jerky-changing-convenience'>bubba</a> ' to one that caters to the evolving desires of millennials, parents, and women.</p> <p>While biltong may never reach critical mass in America, it does seem destined to make a dent in the meat market&#8202;-&#8202;a fitting reward for being uncompromising in a market that was slow to accept them.</p> <p>In fact, making a dent is something South Africans are actively betting on. Last year <a href='https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stryve-biltong-protein-snacks-secures-10-million-investment-to-accelerate-manufacturing-capacity-and-brand-growth-300711865.html'>South African VCs raised R140 million</a> (~14 million dollars) on the premise that Americans would enjoy biltong more than beef jerky.</p> <p>I know which side my money's on.</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"3\",\n        longTitle: \"How Cooking Gives Me Independence Within My Relationship\",\n        shortTitle: \"How Cooking Gives Me Independence Within My Relationship\",\n        img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/t/1200/360/0*0TWwsSgIjZYOHC2B',\n        data: `<div> <p>I've been with my partner my entire adult life. Cooking gives me a way to express myself. </p> <p>I remember the first time I cooked a meal on my own.</p> <p>I was in my third year of university, twenty years old, in a flat shared with a few other people. I'd made sure they were all away while I covertly Skyped my boyfriend who was teaching me to make that student essential: Spaghetti Bolognese.</p> <p>'So you've got your mince browning, and your pasta is boiling&#8202;-&#8202;do you have your chopped tomatoes ready?' he asked, trying to peer into the kitchen via my iPad, propped up on the microwave. I flapped a hand at the camera nervously while I focused on dicing my onions.</p> <p>Step by step, he coached me through my first-ever meal. I sauteed, I fried, I chopped, and I stirred. Finally, I sat down at the end, sweaty-handed and heart still rocketing, to my triumphant meal for one.</p> <p>'And the great thing is,' said my partner, now resting against some cans of beans across the table from me, eating his own meal two hundred miles away, 'is that you'll have leftovers for lunch tomorrow and maybe even dinner, too.'</p> <h3>My partner always cooked.</h3> <p>We got together my first year of college. He was in his third year. He was a great and enthusiastic cook, so he always invited me over for dinners he'd made, or he'd offer to cook at my apartment.</p> <p>(Obviously, I'd always clean up after.)</p> <p>But he did the vast bulk of the cooking. For my first and second year of college, it was rare that I had a meal not prepared by him. On the odd nights when he was busy, I'd eat in the college cafeteria, or eat out, or heat up a pizza. The year he moved away to start his PhD while I finished college, I actually lost weight because I'd often just have a can of tuna or some boiled eggs for dinner.</p> <p>My entire adult life up until that point, I'd been with someone a little older, a little wiser, and a lot better at cooking. The sudden absence of all that took its toll.</p> <p>When I finally asked him if he'd teach me to cook, he was happy to. I could have cracked open a cookbook, I could have looked at one of the many recipes online, but it was a nice way to stay connected with him while avoiding the scary world of unassisted cooking. It's hard for me to remember now, but there was a time when I was terrified of the prospect of cooking a spag bol from scratch.</p> <p>Through him, I learned how to make spag bol, fajitas, pasta carbonara, palak aloo, and bean burgers. I was sad, struggling through long-distance, but cooking was my lifeline. And as I grew braver in the kitchen, and started relying less on his tutelage, and branching out in experimental cooking, I learned that it's actually wonderful&#8202;-&#8202;surprisingly&#8202;-&#8202;to be able to feed yourself.</p> <p>We finally moved in together a year later, and I was happy to contribute to the cooking. I enjoyed looking up new recipes, trying new ingredients, and surprising him with interesting concoctions based on whatever we had left over in the fridge.</p> <p>Cooking meant I didn't have to rely on him to feed myself&#8202;-&#8202;and although it was nice to have that initial reason to stay in contact, it was much nicer to have it as a shared interest and hobby. While I missed him terribly when we tried to make our relationship last long-distance, cooking for myself meant I was doing just fine. It gave me my independence.</p> <p>There's something incredibly satisfying in choosing your meal, selecting the ingredients, preparing them all just so, and watching as out of individual components comes a whole meal greater than the sum of its parts. Just for yourself.</p> <h3>Cooking for two gave me a reason. Cooking for one? It gave me an excuse.</h3> <p>I've learned that an odd thing happens when you spend the vast bulk of your time with one person: you start to depend on them. All your life's patterns, your daily routines, they all revolve in ways both small and large around that other person.</p> <p>My partner and I lived together long enough that we fell into these codependent habits. We grew used to leaning on one another. We forbade screens from our dinner table and focused only on each other.</p> <p>When we were together, we were fine, happy, fulfilled, chasing other passions. We had separate interests, of course, but the vast bulk of our lives were shared. We woke up together, walked to work together, cooked and ate dinner together.</p> <p>However, when he went away for any period of time, I struggled. Even when he was just out for the night, I was much less likely to keep the house clean. I often stayed up too late browsing Twitter, missing the cue to go to bed. I didn't care to exercise as much.</p> <p>And I reverted back to my bad dinner habit.</p> <p>There was no motivation for me to cook anything, and it was just easier to be lazy and eat a pizza. I'd cook it, eat it joylessly while watching Netflix and feel like garbage for not making an effort with the meal. I'd either binge on junk food or forget to eat altogether. Alone, I didn't take care of myself.</p> <p>Here's the kicker: there's no reason for me to be like this. I've got plenty of free time, a grocery store a five-minute walk away, and the knowledge and finances to cook myself whatever I damn well please. There are no excuses&#8202;-&#8202;when my partner is away, I simply don't feel it's worth it.</p> <p>When I cooked for two people, it gave me a reason: a reason to experiment, a reason to explore different flavors and styles, a reason to really get into the cuisine. When it was just me? It gave me <em>an excuse</em> to drop all my good new cooking habits and default to the easiest thing to do.</p> <p>It sounds ridiculous writing it down, that I was so dependent on my partner's presence that without him I couldn't be bothered to look after my health properly. But it was true. I slept worse, I exercised worse, and I ate worse.</p> <h3>I've made a pact with myself.</h3> <p>Things came to a head when my partner was out of town for a week. Morosely, I took myself to the store and bought five frozen pizzas. I was eating the first one, alone at the kitchen table, watching <em>Buffy</em>, as I watched my cats munching down with gusto the dinner I'd prepared for them.</p> <p>It occurred to me that I'd put more effort into their dinner than mine.</p> <p>I've always been a huge proponent of independence within relationships: I have a FOF (f*ck-off fund) in case things ever go south and I need to be financially secure on my own for a few months. I firmly believe in the importance of individual hobbies and interests. I encourage the both of us to cultivate diverse friendship circles.</p> <p>But for some reason, I didn't think I was worth cooking for. For myself and my partner, I'd cook elaborate soups, exciting slow-cooker recipes. For myself? I was worth only a single, cooked-from-frozen pizza. And that wasn't right.</p> <p>So I decided that every time he was away, even if just for one evening, I'd never stoop to a frozen pizza, or a microwave meal, or take-away. I meal-plan. I prep. I use the ingredients we have in the fridge or I buy new ones. And I cook myself an actual meal.</p> <h3>I'm worth a gourmet meal.</h3> <p>Having spent nearly the entirety of my adult life in a relationship with a single person has shaped me. It's had to&#8202;-&#8202;such sustained relationships affect us all, whether we like it or not, in ways we like and ways we don't.</p> <p>And I found I was far more reliant on my partner than I wanted to be. I wish I didn't get mopey when he wasn't around. I wish it didn't affect my sleeping patterns to fall asleep on my own. But I do, and it does.</p> <p>It's not necessarily a bad thing. We're happy together, and we lead independent lives, but when we're so entwined that I can't fathom the thought of cooking just for myself, I can recognize it's time to change something.</p> <p>For me, learning to cook was a way of learning to value myself, my health. It was a way first of proving that I didn't need to be cooked for, that I was my own adult, and then that I valued myself enough to cook healthy, filling, robust meals&#8202;-&#8202;just for myself.</p> <p>And honestly? Sometimes I still mess up. Sometimes I'm so down and sad and feeling lonesome that I can't help but order pizza, or boil the single egg in the pantry. Sometimes the cats still eat better than I do.</p> <p>But I'm getting better. At cooking, at looking after myself, at finding the independence in what's likely to be the longest relationship of my life. And I'll keep on improving.</p> </div>`\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"4\",\n        longTitle: \"Welcome to Frightening Mango Madness\",\n        shortTitle: \"Welcome to Frightening Mango Madness\",\n        img: 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*OmP9XLL-UltP_u8tLji4kQ.jpeg',\n        data: `<div> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*OmP9XLL-UltP_u8tLji4kQ.jpeg'> </figure> <p>How this fruit scared the crap out of me and fooled my doctor.</p> <p>Spring is fully upon us and the damn mango tree in the backyard has spires of tiny fruit in abundance.

An unstoppable dreaded yield's beginning.</p> <strong>Memories of the mango trauma I endured are flooding back&#8202;-&#8202;the mysterious living nightmare.</strong> <p>Working two jobs coupled with family life kept me so busy I barely had time to do anything except sleep and pay bills between my obligations.</p> <p>I earned an afternoon off from my job at Costco and just finished taking care of an account running my lawn business. Being sweaty and dirty, the time seemed perfect to pick mangoes.</p> <p>Hundreds of the green fruit dangle precariously on weak taunting stems mocking me. Fallen mangoes must be avoided.</p> <p>Rats and squirrels nip at the fruit. They leave fleshy remanents rotting on the ground. Wasps build homes in the wasting mangoes.</p> <p>Grabbing low hanging mangoes and bagging them I am stung several times by wasps guarding their territory. The stings are annoying but I keep picking. I also made it a point to dispose of the grounded decomposing fruit.</p> <p>The taste of mangoes repulses me but my neighbors and relatives love them. Mango smell is all over me. Juice seeps from the fruit as I break each mango off the tree. It's sticky and emanating a sweet pungent odor.</p> <strong>Ripe mango scent invades my mouth and I tasted the tropical yuch!</strong> <p>My hands were sticky. I acquired 7 wonderful wasp stings and mosquitoes bit my arms, legs, and neck. After collecting a 100 mangoes my fruit picking afternoon came to a conclusion.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*24sl3qy5n5g8syMdwBFiBg.jpeg'> </figure> <h3>A rough day's rough night.</h3> <p>The insect bites were itching and I tried to resist but I scratched them. Debris from the mango tree fell into my eyes so I used my mango juice covered hands to rub and clear the irritations.</p> <p>Waiting too long to use the bathroom caused me to rush inside and I didn't wash my hands before relieving myself. I vigorously cleaned up and took a shower.</p> <p>As the evening went on I noticed unusual flares of itching all over my body. Infernal, persistent bother. Fortunately, we had Benadryl. I swallowed the medicine and the itching subsided. I fell asleep.</p> <p>But, sleep soon evaded me. Constant agitation awakened me throughout the night. I tried not to scratch and rubbed any irritations. My body blossomed in patches of stinging red blotches.</p> <p>Exhaustion got the best of me and though the itches kept up their assault sleep passed over me for about an hour then the morning arrived. Opening my eyes became a struggle. Sticky goo glued my lids and lashes shut.</p> <p>Rubbing my closed eyes with my palms loosened the gook keeping them shut. But, my vision was obscured and cloudy. The skin around my eye sockets felt puffy and a horrible itching attacked my groin area.</p> <p>The bathroom mirror revealed the horror. My eyes were swollen. Red dotted splotches populated areas all over my body. My groin was on fire and my breathing was irregular.</p> <p>Driving to the doctor required all of my concentration. At least didn't have to go into work at Costco. I had Friday off but my lawn accounts required servicing. Luckily my doctor squeezed me in for an early appointment due to another patient's cancellation.</p> <p>(Maintaining my lawn service accounts, later on, required all my fortitude in getting through the hot, sticky, itchy hell.)</p> <p>Explaining to the doctor about picking the mangos and being stung by wasps several times gave him some concern. He gave me a prescription for a strong dose of the medicine in Benedryl then explained how though I had not been allergic to wasps in the past due to my aging my body was changing.</p> <p>I assumed my doctor was correct and took the medicine. My swelling and itching went away after a few days.</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5vRAd_RO_ZWo3vvXICNCmg.png'> </figure> <h3>Surprising repeat.</h3> <p>Weeks passed and more mangos became ripe for the picking.

I sprayed the mango tree area with tons of vinegar and lemon juice 2 or 3 times since the last mango gathering episode and the wasps were gone.</p> <p>Filling used plastic grocery bags full of mangos for family and neighbors gave me a sense of usefulness. My reward enjoyed by happy thank yous. Though I couldn't stand the mango taste everyone else seemed to love them.</p> <p>Mango tree sap covered my fingers and hands again. I didn't think much about the sticky juice.</p> <p>The next morning I awakened to eyes glued shut. My body itched all over. But, I hadn't been stung by wasps. What the hell was going on?</p> <p>Then the notion struck me. Maybe I was allergic to mangos. The idea seemed odd. I never heard of a mango allergy.</p> <p>Rushing to my computer I wondered if my doctor ever considered or knew of mango sensitivity.</p> <p>I have eaten fresh mango, drank mango juice, and eaten desserts made with mango but never had an allergic reaction to such foods.

I found topical diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and applied the cream to itchy outbreaks covering my body.

The stings are just an annoyance.</p> <p>But, mango trees are dangerous to me. My mango tree yells danger at me.</p> <p>Now, when I pick mangos I go in fully covered. My outfit consists of pants, a long sleeved shirt, an old, large, well-used windbreaker (with a high neck), a hat, protective side-paneled glasses, boots, and plastic gloves.</p> <strong>Absolutely no skin exposure!</strong> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wRnVXmh52d4YiI8T5Yf5zw.jpeg'> </figure> <p>I don't care if it's close to 100&#730; Fahrenheit and I'm covered in a lake of perspiration while picking mangos.

You may not have heard too much about it but according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO), urban agriculture is something that is practised by <a href='http://www.fao.org/urban-agriculture/en/'>800 million people worldwide</a>, over one-tenth of the global population. So what exactly is it and how is it changing how we produce and distribute food?</p> <strong>What is urban farming?</strong> <p>Urban farming, or urban agriculture, can be described as the growing of plants and raising of animals in and around towns, cities and urban environments. Until recently, farming has been a largely rural activity. But the development of technology, together with a pressing need to find more sustainable ways of production and consumption, has led to the adaptation of farming techniques in more built up environments.</p> <p>There are several different types of urban farms of varying scales that exist in different parts of the world, including commercial city farms, community gardens, community orchards, indoor vertical farms, hydroponic greenhouses, rooftop gardens, urban aquaponic farms (or fish farms), urban beehives and small-scale homestead farms. They produce a range of goods for local consumption or retail, such as grains, vegetables, fruit, meat, poultry, fish, herbs, honey and dairy products.</p> <p>Urban farms can be small, medium or large-scale commercial enterprises, cooperatives run by community groups or residents, or even individual set ups. The farms have proliferated in both developed and developing countries in recent years, serving slightly different purposes in general in each. Farms in wealthier industrialised nations have largely been in response to the challenge to find more sustainable methods of agricultural production, along with moves towards more localized economies. In poorer countries, they have come about through multi-stakeholder efforts to combat food insecurity and hunger levels.</p> <strong>Why has urban farming become popular?</strong> <p>Urban farming has grown in popularity over the last 10-15 years. In the developing world, it has largely been driven by the rapid urbanization of developing regions. The urban population across the developing world has grown by around 500 million in the last decade and it is predicted that, by 2025, <a href='http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/whyuph/index.html'>more than half of the developing world</a> will live in urban areas. The main drivers of urban growth in these countries are high birth rates and an influx of rural people trying to escape poverty. Unlike countries where urbanization has been driven by industrialization, in low income areas it is often accompanied by high levels of poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. Urban farming has been seen as a way to combat all three of these problems.</p> <p>In richer nations, the growth of urban agriculture has been in tandem with a return to localism, the growth of localized businesses, social entrepreneurialism and ethically-minded start ups. Social good and environmental sustainability are high on the agenda with new businesses, with one study finding that <a href='https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_next_phase_of_business_sustainability'>90% of today's CEOs and 88% of business students</a> believe that sustainability is an important part of commercial success. Finding new and improved agricultural methods is an important area of sustainability. <a href='https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/agriculture-and-food-systems-unsustainable'>Studies have found</a> that agriculture uses 38% of the world's land area and is responsible for over 70% of global freshwater consumption. With more people concentrated in urban areas, farms can be more productive without using up the same level of resources. Warmer urban conditions are also conducive to the growing of crops.</p> <p>Not all urban farming practices, however, are for a commercial profit. There are many such as community gardens and community orchards that are run by charities, community groups or resident cooperatives and exist for more social purposes such as sharing food, providing for poorer sections of the community, or bringing parts of the community together.</p> <strong>What are the impacts of urban farming?</strong> <p>Impact on businesses and the economy</p> <p>Urban farming can have many positive effects on the local economy. As well as presenting green-fingered entrepreneurs with opportunities to start new local businesses, it also creates job opportunities for local people. Furthermore, farms can often provide local shops, supermarkets and restaurants with cheaper and fresher produce which has knock-on positive effects.<a href='https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/02/big-data-suggests-big-potential-for-urban-farming/552770/'> One study has estimated</a> that urban farms have the potential to provide around 10% of global vegetable crops, which could translate into big savings for local economies worldwide. Start up costs, however, are still high. Those involved in urban farming typically work longer than average hours, lose more food than rural farmers due to urban pests, and struggle to find skilled and experienced staff.</p> <p>Impact on the environment</p> <p>Urban farming has been championed as a way of improving agricultural environmental sustainability, but in truth it can have both positive and negative effects and it comes down to the way that farms operate and are regulated. Farms can provide a more efficient way of meeting local demand. If operated sustainably, they can reduce both the agricultural energy footprint (through eliminating the need to store and transport imported products) and the water footprint (through sustainable irrigation and water recycling). They can also transform wasteland into productive green space and stop it from becoming polluted. Vertical farms, which are set up inside multi-storey buildings and warehouses, also have the benefit of saving on space.</p> <p>But studies have shown that urban farms can also increase energy and water use. Indoor farms, such as vertical farms, use energy-intensive artificial lighting and climate control systems. Many farms <a href='https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/urban-farms-could-be-incredibly-efficient-but-arent-yet/'>use the municipal water supply</a> rather than a recycled water system for irrigation. There are also distinct health and safety risks with urban farming. Urban land can be contaminated with pollutants, while wastewater if not treated properly can contain human pathogens. This can compromise food safety if strict regulations are not in place.</p> <p>Impact on communities</p> <p>There are a number of positive social impacts associated with urban farming, such as:</p> <ul> <li>improving food security and reducing poverty among the poorest by providing cheaper and more easily available food;</li> <li>health benefits of providing affordable nutritious fruit, vegetables and organically produced meat;</li> <li>greater social inclusion by providing local job opportunities and, in the case of community projects, bringing communities together;</li> <li>educational opportunities for children, e.g. school trips to city farms and community gardens where pupils can learn more about where food comes from</li> </ul> <p>However, urban farming has <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/15/urban-farming-rich-hipsters-food-affordability-inequality'>attracted some criticism</a> in places such as Europe for becoming monopolized by the middle-classes and excluding lower income groups.</p> <strong>Who are the main players in urban farming?</strong> <p>Europe</p> <p>Urban farming in Europe is not a new phenomenon. In fact, several countries encouraged the production of food in urban environments during both the First and Second World Wars in the 20th century. Today, start up urban agriculture enterprises are cropping up across the continent. At governmental level, individual governments have had limited involvement but the EU-funded <a href='http://www.urban-agriculture-europe.org/'>Urban Agriculture Europe</a>, a network of over 120 researchers, have been looking into ways in which urban farming can play a key role in future EU agricultural policy. Berlin-based start up <a href='https://infarm.com/'>InFarm</a> has become the European urban farming leader with over 100 indoor and outdoor city farms in Germany, France and Switzerland. Among the largest urban farms in Europe are <a href='http://www.spaceandmatter.nl/urbanfarmers'>Space&amp;Matter</a> in the Netherlands, the <a href='https://www.jonesfoodcompany.co.uk/'>Jones Food Company</a> vertical farm in the UK, and the <a href='http://bigh.farm/'>BIGH</a> rooftop farm in Belgium.</p> <p>America</p> <p>There has been a growth in urban farming across the American continent in recent decades. In the US, policies and initiatives vary between states but projects ranging from vertical hydroponic enterprises to community gardens flourish across the country. A 2012 study by the <a href='https://www.usda.gov/'>United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) identified over 300 urban farms in the US. This includes<a href='http://www.gothamgreens.com/our-farms/pullman'> one of the world's largest urban farms</a> located across nearly two acres in Chicago. In Canada, there has been more state-level involvement. Toronto in particular has been proactive, setting up a Food Policy Council which has drawn up a <a href='http://tfpc.to/news/growto-action-plan'>GrowTO Urban</a> Agriculture Action Plan. In south and central America, where poverty and food insecurity are big issues in several countries, the UNFAO has been involved in kick-starting <a href='http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/projects/index.html'>urban micro-gardens projects</a> in countries including Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela.</p> <p>Asia</p> <p>Several Asian countries have invested significant amounts in urban farming technologies as a way of dealing with population growth and combating food insecurity. China, which has industrialized at a rapid pace in recent decades, has become a <a href='https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/chinas-indoor-farming-research-feed-cities-leads-world/409606/'>world leader in indoor vertical farming</a> thanks to state investment. Similarly, Thailand has a community-supported agriculture initiative, led by the <a href='http://www.tei.or.th/th/index.php'>Thailand Environment Institute</a>, that has helped create rooftop farms and indoor vertical farms across Bangkok. In India, another country that has urbanized at a pace, urban farming is now being seen as a sustainable food production method. Methods such as <a href='https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/rooftop-revolution-50161'>rooftop farming</a> have taken off in cities such as Kerala.</p> <p>Africa</p> <p>The African continent has also seen wide-scale urbanization in recent years. Urban farming methods in the poorest countries have largely centred around setting up micro-gardening and community gardening projects, overseen by <a href='http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/projects/index.html'>UNFAO</a>, equipping urban locals with skills and resources to produce sustainable and feed the local community. Methods such as vertical farming are starting to take hold in some African countries. Johannesburg has hosted two Urban Agri Africa Summits to date, looking into possibilities of developing urban farming technologies across the continent.</p> <p>Urban farming is unlikely to replace traditional agriculture any time soon but it will have a vital role to play in addressing challenges such as environmental sustainability and food insecurity in the coming years. As the world continues to urbanize and new technologies emerge, we can expect to see increasing governmental and inter-governmental involvement as urban farming becomes more mainstream. The key stakeholders will need to make sure that business models stay alert to environmental, social and economic challenges so that the farming of the future is a sustainable benefit for all.</p> </div>`\n    },\n\n];\nexport default articlesFood;","import React from 'react';\nimport articlesFood from \"../../Data/Food\";\nimport styled from \"@emotion/styled\";\nimport { HashRouter} from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport {CardArticle} from \"../CardArticle/CardArticle\";\n\nconst StyledWraper = styled.div`\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-wrap: wrap;\njustify-content: space-around;\n`;\nconst StyledHeader = styled.h1`\ntext-align: center;\ncolor: #373A47;\nfont-size: 1.5rem;\n`;\n\nexport function Food() {\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <StyledHeader>Food</StyledHeader>\n            <HashRouter>\n        <StyledWraper>\n\n\n            {articlesFood.map((item, i) =>    <CardArticle item ={item}/>)}\n        </StyledWraper>\n            </HashRouter>\n        </>\n    );\n};\n","const articlesSport = [\n  {\n    slugName: \"0\",\n    longTitle: 'Gotzis: Katarina Johnson-Thompson wins heptathlon with personal best score',\n    shortTitle: 'The most exciting player since Ronaldo?

'But at 19, he did not show the talent that Felix is showing in this moment at 19 - so imagine what kind of player we are talking about.'</p> <h3>'If a club bid 100m euros, he stays'</h3> <p>Felix started his career with Porto's youth team but was released in 2015, <a href='https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/benfica/noticias/interior/joao-felix-o-magricela-que-escapou-ao-fc-porto-e-brilha-no-benfica-6245594.html'>reportedly</a> for being 'too skinny' and joined their rivals.</p> <p>He shone at Benfica, and at 16 became their reserve team's youngest ever player when he made his debut in September 2016.</p> <p>But 2018-19 has been his breakthrough season and in November he signed a new deal until 2023 - which includes that 120m euro release clause.</p> <p>His first-team debut came against Boavista in August and in the next game he scored his first goal against city rivals Sporting Lisbon, with a header in the 86th minute after coming on as a second-half substitute.</p> <p>His appearances were limited thereafter under former manager Rui Vitoria, but he has been ever-present under new boss Bruno Lage, who took over in January - scoring twice in Lage's first match and ending the season with 20 goals from 43 games in all competitions.</p> <p>Among teenagers across the top divisions of Europe's leading leagues - England, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Portugal and the Netherlands - Felix is second in league goals only to Bayer Leverkusen's 19-year-old German midfielder Kai Havertz.</p> <p>And he is only behind Borussia Dortmund's England winger Jadon Sancho for goal contributions among that group.</p> <p>'Inside Benfica it was very clear he was the best talent in the academy,' said Carvalhal.</p> <p>'The transition to being a professional is not easy, but to him it was so easy. When you see him off the pitch, talk with him, see him talk in the media, you can see a happy boy. The pressure to win is something he deals with very well.'</p> <p>Benfica chief executive Domingos Soares de Oliveira recently said a club would need to meet Felix's release clause to sign him.</p> <p>'If a club beat 100m euros for Felix, the intention is not to sell,' <a href='https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/domingos-soares-de-oliveira-se-alguem-bater-100-milhoes-pelo-felix-a-intencao-e-nao-vender?ref=HP_1BucketDestaquesPrincipais'>he explained.</a> 'A hundred million euros is a lot of money, there was never any sales of this value in Portugal, but our main goal is to win on the pitch and we will do everything to keep the players who help us win on the pitch.</p> <p>'If the clause is 120m and someone hits 80m, 90m or 100m, the player stays.'</p> <p>Former Swansea and Sheffield Wednesday assistant manager Lage has said: 'We're not going to turn Joao Felix into a superhero.</p> <p>'He's a fantastic kid and still has a lot to learn, technically and tactically. We're not putting him under any pressure; we just want him to play his natural game and keep growing. That's what we believe will happen working with us.'</p> <p>Jose Delgado, deputy director at Portuguese sports newspaper A Bola, said Benfica want to keep the player for another year, but added 'that might not be possible.'</p> <p>'Since Ronaldo we have not had a player so exciting and young like him until now,' he told BBC Sport.</p> <h3>'Better than Silva at the same age'</h3> <p>Felix will always be compared with Portugal's current players like five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo and Manchester City's Silva.</p> <p>But he is often compared to former AC Milan and Brazil forward Kaka.</p> <p>'They've already called him my heir or the new Kaka,' ex-Benfica and Portugal forward Rui Costa has said. 'To be honest, Felix is just Felix. He has an extraordinary understanding of the game and the rare ability to know where to be in front of goal.'</p> <p>Carvalhal added: 'His characteristics are more near Kaka in my opinion, the way he drives the ball, connects play and his goals.</p> <p>'Why is he so special? He's a mix between a nine and a 10, he plays like a second striker. He is a good header, even if he is not a massive player physically.</p> <p>'He knows how to find space well in the last line of defence, that is why he scores a lot and he shoots well with both feet. When he must connect the game between attack and midfield he does so very well. He's a very good technical player.</p> <p>'What makes him different is he is a number nine when he goes to the last line of defence and he scores goals. But he is also a very good player to connect the game between the lines, to assist and pass.</p> <p>'That is why we are talking about the big clubs being interested in him. It is not a surprise to me because since the beginning we have been looking at a talented player.</p> <p>'At 19 he needs to grow up and learn. If he stays at Benfica it would be a good place for him, but if he moves to another club, I hope he will go to a team and manager that understands the football that allows this kind of player to play.'</p> </div>`\n  },\n  {\n    slugName: \"2\",\n    longTitle: 'French Open 2019: Roger Federer into second round with straight-set win',\n    shortTitle: 'Federer wins on French Open return',\n    img:'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/10127/production/_107113856_federer_afp.jpg',\n    data: `<div> <figure> <img src='https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/10127/production/_107113856_federer_afp.jpg'></figure><div> <div> <p><b>Venue: </b>Roland Garros, Paris <b>Dates:</b> 26 May-9 June</p> </div> <div> <p><b>Coverage: </b>Live text and radio commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app.</p> </div> </div> <p>Roger Federer made a winning return to the French Open with a dominant first-round victory over Lorenzo Sonego.</p> <p>The Swiss 20-time Grand Slam winner, playing at Roland Garros for the first time in four years, beat the Italian 6-2 6-4 6-4.</p> <p>He arrived to a standing ovation on Philippe Chatrier court and left with the crowd on their feet in delight.</p> <p>The 37-year-old will play German lucky loser Oscar Otte, ranked 145th in the world, in the second round. </p> <p>'I knew I can play very well on clay and I am very happy I did it in straight sets today,' Federer said.</p> <p>'I missed the French crowd so thanks for the warm welcome today.'</p> <ul> <li><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/48413550'>Kerber suffers shock first-round defeat</a></li> <li><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/live-scores'>Live scores, schedule and results</a></li> <li><a href='https://www.bbc.com/sport/35176037'>Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone</a></li> </ul> <h3>Four years away -

As a disadvantage, this type of memory is (comparatively) slow. Some examples can be a hard disk, an optical disc (CD, DVD or Bluray) or a USB stick.</li> <li> <strong>Volatile memory</strong> is very fast but it requires energy continuously to maintain its contents. Because of its speed, volatile memory is used as the working memory of the computer.</li> </ul> <p>This working memory is managed by the operating system, which controls which processes are running and allocates a space to each process. Each process stores in this space the data it is manipulating at this moment and requests resources from the operating system (such as more memory, access to the CPU or access to a peripheral) that it must release when it no longer needs them.</p> <p>A program can have programming errors that cause the computer to behave in an unstable way:</p> <ul> <li>For example, a programming error can cause a program to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU without doing anything and slowing down the rest of the processes.</li> <li>Other programming errors focus on an inadequate use of resources: a process requests a large amount of resources, or is making small requests over time but without releasing resources previously obtained. The final result is that the rest of the processes have few available resources and must wait until they are free. In particular, memory management can be a problematic area. In addition to hoarding memory without releasing it, a process may try to access memory that either had not requested or had previously released. This erroneous access can modify the data of the process in an unexpected way or, in more extreme cases, modify the data of other processes or the binary code of some process.</li> <li>The operating system can also have its own defects that cause resources to be permanently blocked without being used or processes that end their execution but still occupy resources.</li> </ul> <p>The reboot of a computer is a way to repair the working memory \\'in a forced way\\': eliminating it and starting from scratch. Using this method, it is not necessary to worry about the cause of the problem: we return to a \\'correct\\' state of the working memory and, if the same circumstances that led to the error do not happen again, they will not happen again.</p> <h4>Thus, restarting a computer is so effective for three reasons:</h4> <ol> <li>Because it serves to solve different types of problems at the same time: accumulation of resources, zombie processes, programs that have entered infinite loop, corruption of memory, etc.</li> <li>Because we do not need to spend time diagnosing the cause of the problem.</li> <li>Because if the error appeared due to a combination of unusual circumstances, it will generally not occur again and it will appear that we have \\'fixed\\' the problem.</li> </ol> <p>However, it must be borne in mind that restarting is not a solution to all problems. For example, it does not solve hardware problems or eliminate malware (if it exists). And it will not solve the error if our computer is not powerful enough, either because we run too many programs when starting the computer or because the program we want to use needs more resources than we have.</p> </div>'\n    },\n    {\n        slugName: \"4\",\n        longTitle: \"Flying Cars: Fool's Gold or Paradigm Shift?\",\n        shortTitle:\"Flying Cars: Fool's Gold or Paradigm Shift?\",\n        img:'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7V-Uqfq5uQENMp_-rNtNUw.jpeg',\n        data: `<div> <p>By Kevin Sara, Venture Partner, Aster</p> <figure><img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7V-Uqfq5uQENMp_-rNtNUw.jpeg'> </figure> <p>Dozens of start-ups have emerged over the past few years boldly announcing we have the technology; flying cars are here (or almost). Serious money is being thrown at electric and hybrid aviation, and credible backers are not lacking. Even the incumbent aircraft manufacturers are backing start-ups and launching their own in-house development programs. At the same time, the detractors say yes, maybe one day we'll fly electric, but not anytime soon, mostly due to limitations of current battery performance.</p> <p>Over the past 30 years I've experienced some fundamental industry transformations as a banker, investor and entrepreneur. I've seen technology innovation fundamentally transform massive industries such as telecommunications, computing and energy.</p> <p>Today, I am seeing the signs of such a transformation in aviation. This article looks at the background to electric aviation, the challenges it faces today, and some indications about where attractive investment opportunities are likely to emerge.</p> <h4>1884: Electric Airships</h4> <p>It is well known that the electric car made a brief appearance at the beginning of the 20th century, only to be overwhelmed by the superior performance range of gasoline-powered vehicles.</p> <p>Less known is the fact that the first powered flights were electrically powered and with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) capability The first powered aircraft, the dirigible 'La France,' flew an 8 km trip around Chalais Meudon in 1884, using bespoke electric motors powered by a zinc-chlorine battery with an energy density of around 30 Wh/kg. Despite a series of successful flights, the aircraft's range was too limited by its batteries to be further developed, and the glory days of the Zeppelin era were powered by diesel. Gasoline and other oil derivatives have reigned over aviation ever since.</p> <p>Why? Because fossil fuels simply pack in so much more energy than batteries for a given weight and aircraft range is highly sensitive to the energy density of its propulsive fuel, as described by the Breguet range equation. Electric 'fuel' is further disadvantaged compared to conventional fuels because batteries do not lose weight as they discharge, further reducing range compared to combustible fuels.</p> <h4>1973: Electric Airplanes</h4> <p>It was not until the first oil crisis that electric powered aircraft made its reappearance: in October 1973 the first electric airplane (fixed-wings) flight took place in Austria based on a repurposed glider and was powered by VARTA nickel-cadmium batteries and a Bosch electric motor (borrowed from a forklift). The flight lasted for 14 minutes and achieved an altitude of 360 meters. As the oil crisis abated, so did interest in electric aviation. Only half dozen or so electric airplane projects had flown by the end of the last century.</p> <p>In more recent times, an important catalyst for the revival of electric aviation has been NASA's <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/centennial_challenges/pastchallenges/index.html'>Centennial Challenges</a> program, a series of innovation prizes launched to mark the Centennial of the Wright Brother's first powered airplane flight in 1903. In particular, the <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/centennial_challenges/general_aviation/index.html'>Green Flight Challenge</a>, designed to push the limits of energy efficiency of flight and which featured the largest cash prize ever awarded in aviation history (total purse of $1.65 million, sponsored by Google), drew 14 entrants. The challenge was to fly 200 miles in less than 2 hours using less than a gallon of fuel (or energy equivalent) per passenger. In 2011, the contest was won by the Slovenian Pipistrel flying an all-electric airplane, using lithium polymer cells with an energy density of 173 Whr/kg. <a href='https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/'>Pipistrel</a> remains one of market leaders for electric light aircraft and is currently developing an eVTOL (as a partner of the <a href='https://www.uber.com/gb/en/elevate/'>UBER Elevate</a> initiative).</p> <p>The Green Flight Challenge illustrated that electric aviation had come of age; and that battery technology and electrical propulsion systems had become sufficiently performant, at least for small electric aircraft.</p> <h4>2009-11: Electric Helicopters</h4> <p>Vertical take-off and landing aircraft are more demanding on power sources than conventional aircraft, which benefit more from the forces of lift to stay aloft. It was not until 2009 that a fully electric helicopter was developed and flown in 2011 by Pascal Chr&#233;tien and <a href='http://newsite.solutionf.fr/'>Solution F</a> in France, as a demonstrator. The aircraft was powered by <a href='http://kokam.com/'>Kokam</a> lithium cobalt pouch cells which had an energy density of 160 Wh/kg. So even for helicopters, battery technology had reached a degree of maturity sufficient at least for short flights.</p> <h3>Flying Cars, electric and hybrid airplanes</h3> <p>These clear demonstrations of the capabilities of electric propulsion and battery performance heralded a new era in aviation and drew entrepreneurs, capital and new ideas to the sector, many driven by a 'clean tech' ethos. For example, <a href='http://www.jobyaviation.com/'>Joby Aviation</a> ('...advancing the transition to sustainable aviation') was founded in 2009, <a href='https://kittyhawk.aero/'>Kitty Hawk</a> in 2010 ('...we will improve our urban and natural environments with efficient and reliable mobility'), <a href='https://www.volocopter.com/en/company/'>Volocopter</a> in 2012 ('a green helicopter'), and <a href='https://zunum.aero/#About-us'>Zunum</a> in 2013 ('...get anywhere fast, and leave behind a healthy planet').</p> <p>Some of the incumbent manufacturers took notice of the potential of electrification around this time as well. Sikorsky (now part of <a href='https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/sikorsky/sikorsky-commercial-aircraft-and-services.html'>Lockheed Martin</a>) attempted to retrofit an existing product, replacing the thermal engine with an electric motors and batteries. And at the end of 2010, a 'skunkworks' project was initiated at AgustaWestland in Italy (now <a href='https://www.leonardocompany.com/'>Leonardo</a>) to develop a fully electric tiltrotor eVTOL as a technology demonstrator. After test flights in 2011, the aircraft was revealed to the public in 2013. <a href='https://www.airbus.com/'>Airbus</a> developed a 2 seater all electric demostrator (the 'E-Fan') which flew in 2014.</p> <p>During this period played a key role in promoting the idea of electric and distributed propulsion, releasing several conceptual designs and funding a sub-scale tilt-wing hybrid demonstrator ('Greased Lightning') which flew in 2015.</p> <h3>Drones</h3> <p>And another force came into play during this period: drones. As consumer drones increased in capability with better batteries and higher payloads, the commercial potential became apparent. New markets in aerial photography and surveying, inspection, agriculture, and security have been evolving quickly, and market overlap with helicopters is already apparent. Off-the-shelf drone technology also allows the rapid prototyping of new eVTOL concepts, and the push for delivery drones is forcing regulatory bodies to put in place air traffic management systems&#8202;-&#8202;which will be essential for the eventual deployment of 'flying cars'.</p> <h3>UBER Elevate</h3> <p>Perhaps the biggest catalyst for electric aviation has come from the UBER Elevate initiative. Launched by the publication of a <a href='https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf'>White Paper</a> in 2016, UBER proposed to develop an ecosystem for urban air mobility as an extension of its existing 'on-demand' ground mobility services. Subsequent conferences and industry gatherings have fleshed out a full vision of the ecosystem and design requirements (eVTOL common reference models) have been published. UBER has engaged closely with aircraft manufacturers (including <a href='https://embraerx.embraer.com/global/en'>EMBRAER</a>, <a href='https://www.bellflight.com/'>BELL</a>, <a href='https://www.aurora.aero/'>BOEING/Aurora</a>, <a href='https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/'>Pipistrel</a> and <a href='https://www.karemaircraft.com/'>KAREM</a>) and the cities of Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth, with the aim of launching commercial operations in 2023. UBER's vehicle requirements will only accommodate fully electric aircraft and vertiport specifications do not allow for combustible fuel.</p> <p>The promise of a huge market facilitated by UBER has drawn dozens of new entrants into the market since 2016. The website <a href='http://evtol.news/'>evtol.news</a> keeps a running tab of eVTOL projects and start-ups&#8202;-&#8202;there are 167 of them listed as of May 14 2019, and many innovative designs are emerging.</p> <h3>Big Questions remain</h3> <p>Above all, it's about the performance of batteries. If it took engineers over one hundred years to progress from 30 Wh/kg to 160 Wh/kg, how long is it going to take to make the next leap? Aviation fuel (Jet-A) has an energy density of 11,000 Wh/kg!</p> <p>The answer is that such a leap might not be necessary. Electric motors are inherently more efficient than thermal engines, by as much as a factor of 2. Moreover, electric propulsion scales linearly, enabling distributed propulsion. Distributed propulsion allows better airframe designs with superior lift/drag ratios than conventionally designed aircraft.</p> <p>Hybrid designs, especially where a generator is used to power distributed electric motors, can allow aircraft to benefit from some of the advantages of distributed propulsion, and obtain longer ranges or higher payloads without having to wait for battery technology to improve. <a href='https://zunum.aero/'>Zunum</a> in the US and <a href='https://www.voltaero.aero/en/'>Voltaero</a> in France are taking this approach.</p> <p>But limitations in battery performance is unlikely to put much of a brake on this new sector for the simple reason that most flights are relatively short. Many routes (especially short helicopter hops, like Nice to Monaco) are well within the range of existing technology. Many more routes will soon be in range as improvements are beginning to be commercialized.</p> <p>UBER Elevate specification calls for 300Wh/kg for aircraft put into commercial service in 2023, and it has assured its aircraft partners that it is working with battery partners to ensure this can be achieved. With the current growth of the terrestrial EV market, there is no lack of focus on improving batteries. Additionally, new chemistries, such as solid-state lithium ( <a href='https://www.blue-solutions.com/en/'>Bollor&#233;</a>, <a href='https://www.saftbatteries.com/'>SAFT</a> and others), lithium metal ( <a href='http://www.pelliontech.com/'>Pellion Technologies</a> for example) and lithium sulphur ( <a href='https://oxisenergy.com/'>Oxis Energy</a>) are beginning to be commercialized. Oxis Energy recently announced a 450 Wh/kg cell, and funding for a factory to build them in Brazil. Even though battery technology remains in flux and certification challenges remain, it is unlikely that batteries will constrain the development of at least short-haul electric flight.</p> <h3>Other Forces at play</h3> <p>What's really driving electric aviation and the market for 'flying cars' and electric airplanes?</p> <p>1)<strong> Environmental concerns.</strong> The initial impetus for electric aviation came from the 'Green Flight Challenge.' Although the industry incumbents try to make light of it and claim that aviation accounts for merely 2% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most observers agree that it's one of the fastest growing sources of GHG. Many suspect that the 2% figure is a very significant under-estimate, especially if the warming effect of contrails are taken into account. The carbon footprint of commercial aviation has long been a pet-peeve of environmentalists and some have even vowed to stop flying completely, or at least severely limit it. A 'shame of flying' or <em>flygskam</em> has entered into the public consciousness in Sweden to the point that domestic air travel demand declined in 2018, with a commensurate increase in demand of intercity train travel. Governments are beginning to respond to these concerns; the Norwegian government has mandated all-electric domestic flights by 2040. Environmental concerns may also become a key driver for the deployment at scale of cargo and delivery drones.</p> <p>2) <strong>The flying car fantasy. </strong>No one likes getting stuck in traffic and if a similarly priced alternative is available, as promised by the likes of UBER, what is there not to like?</p> <p>3) The promise of <strong>'distributed aviation'</strong> and <strong>regional air taxi services</strong>. The mega-hub system is designed to serve the operational efficiency of airlines flying large fossil fueled aircraft. Many people (in mature developed economies) live within a few miles of a local airfield, and their final destination is within a few miles of a local airfield. Regional aviation has been constrained by high costs and noise. If both of these constraints are removed, a renaissance in regional aviation may ensue.</p> <p>4) <strong>Cargo drones </strong>are paving the way for eVTOLs. Easily accepted by society initially for the enhanced delivery of emergency medical services and transport of medical samples, it will be a small step to introduce air ambulances, especially if they are quieter and less costly than existing helicopters. Similar acceptability will be found for fire-fighting. As functional drones are normalized, last mile delivery is likely to become more acceptable, especially if lower carbon footprints can be demonstrated.</p> <h3>Turbulence</h3> <p>Let's assume that incremental improvement in batteries is sufficient to economically serve short urban/suburban and even regional routes.</p> <p>What could still prevent this market from emerging at scale anytime soon?</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Noise</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;all of the new market entrants are promising quieter aircraft, sometimes much more quiet than existing ones. If this benefit does not materialize, public acceptance for new airport facilities and increased usage of existing ones may prove to be very difficult.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Costs&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;as with noise, everyone is promising a big reduction in costs, especially in operating and maintenance costs. While it's clear that 'electric' fuel is usually less expensive than the hydrocarbon equivalent, it may not be the case in all refueling locations. Also, battery life for this new application remains uncertain, and they may need to be replaced more often than anticipated.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Infrastructure&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;many new infrastructure elements need to be put into place for this industry to emerge, including the obvious 'vertiports' for flying taxis, but also the electrical charging infrastructure. According to some estimates, even a modest recharging facility at an airport will require a doubling of existing electrical power availability. Existing air traffic management systems will need to be upgraded or supplemented to accommodate increase traffic, and traffic flying in new corridors. Who will pay for these infrastructure elements remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Certification&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;it goes without saying that safety is of paramount importance. Commercial air transport has an exemplary safety record, and it's highly unlikely that standards or passenger expectation will be lowered. Certification bodies face major challenges to evaluate and certify new technologies, and are likely, given recent events surrounding the 737MAX, to be overly cautious.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Pilots&#8202;</strong> -&#8202;a renaissance in regional aviation and the emergence of ultra-short-haul eVTOLs will require a significant increase in licensed pilots. Certification agencies also need to adapt licensing to accommodate the new technologies of eVTOLs and electric propulsion. Autonomous systems can overcome this constraint, if and when certification and regulatory authorities agree.</p> <p>Paradigm shift or not, the race is on to build and deploy these new electric aircraft. Long term success will depend on how well and how quickly market participants navigate through these areas of turbulence.</p> <p>For investors, deciding where to place bets is challenging. Let's first consider who makes money in aviation today; the most profitable links in the air transport industry value chain are the ticket sellers and the computer reservation systems. This throws an interesting light on UBER's positioning in the industry. Other attractive segments include all freight forwarders, navigation and other services provided to the airlines.</p> <p>To what degree this value chain holds in the transition to an electrified industry remains to be seen, and a big question hanging over the sector is: who is going to take the risk to purchase, finance, insure, and operate these new aircraft?</p> <h3>Attractive investment themes in electric aviation</h3> <p><a href='https://www.aster.com/'>Aster</a> has been investing in early and growth stage innovators driving industry transformations for the past 20 years. We've developed a number of investment themes in electric aviation and urban air mobility which leverage and complement our existing investing activity in mobility, energy and industry. Our main themes in aviation include:</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Ticket sales</strong> and computer reservation systems. There is already a brisk business in fractional ownership and reselling capacity on private aircraft, including helicopters.</p> <p>&#183; The <strong>supply chain</strong> of the new aircraft manufacturers&#8202;-&#8202;batteries, battery management systems, electrical control systems, motors; avionics, sensors, navigation aids, autonomous pilot systems. High fidelity design tools for electric propulsion.</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Infrastructure</strong> <strong>and services</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;including vertiports, warehouses for delivery drones, air traffic management systems, battery charging, maintenance.</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Cargo and delivery drones</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;buoyant existing market for equipment and services, fewer regulatory constraints.</p> <p>&#183; <strong>Aircraft manufacturers</strong> &#8202;-&#8202;rigorous assessment of management and technical teams required, as well as technical review of design concept and execution capability. Entry barriers seem deceptively low; many start-ups will hit the wall as they attempt to undergo certification of their aircraft.</p> <h3>Paradigm Shift?</h3> <p>We most probably are in the midst of a paradigm shift: the underlying assumptions about the air transport industry may no longer hold. Market entrants arriving with new technologies present both challenges and opportunities for the incumbents. Airport planners and civil aviation authorities need to consider that growth may also come from regional airports rather than just mega-hubs. Cities and regions need to consider the benefits and risks of introducing urban air mobility and cargo drones. For the old guard a paradigm shift represents both threats and opportunities: existing airlines may be surprised by how quickly new entrants begin to erode the edges of their already fragile businesses.</p> <strong>Whether you are an entrepreneur, a corporate or an investor, we invite you to discuss joining us in this new adventure.

It has to be at least 500. We trust these metrics more than we trust how our clothes fit or how our bodies look.</p> <p>We have been conditioned to collect, track, and obsess over data regarding our personal health and wellness to the point that it's difficult to actually be well anymore.</p> <p>It even stretches into our religious practices, for those who practice, and contributes to our spiritual fears. Did we break our fast a minute too early by accident? Back in the day, the fast was broken at sunset&#8202;-&#8202;but now we can time the sunset with such precision that we assume God is judging us using the same strict metrics.</p> <p>We've become numb to disturbing web content. Graphic videos&#8202;-&#8202;including extremely triggering videos&#8202;-&#8202;go viral and show up on our news feeds on autoplay. No matter how sick we feel, we sometimes watch them more than once. We've have been conditioned to watch things that we don't even want to watch and wouldn't have sought out on our own. It's hard to be well when this happens again and again.</p> <p>On one hand, technology can open our eyes to the world around us&#8202;-&#8202;but on the other hand, I didn't need to see that video of a child bleeding out on the floor in order to believe that it happened. I didn't need to watch the first-person perspective video from the New Zealand mosque shooting in order to understand the severity of that situation. I didn't ask to receive this content, but I did. I used to make light of trigger warnings, but now I understand them.</p> <p>See how quickly this escalated?</p> <p>It's also the reason I've pretty much accepted that my anxiety cannot be cured. No amount of deep breathing, meditation, or trigger elimination can take it away.</p> <p>There is too much that we have the ability to know, to track, to find out, to think about.</p> <p>What we don't know can't hurt us. But now, we CAN know. We can watch our biggest fears unfold in real time.</p> <p>I know the knowledge is out there&#8202;-&#8202;and now I need it.</p> <p>I'm afraid to <em>not</em> know.</p> <p>I can turn off every device. I can cancel my internet. I can refuse to look when someone offers to show me a 'crazy video'.

These treatments are designed to prevent dependence on benzodiazepines and to help patients 'stabilize' their moods so that they won't be 'too' anxious.</p> <p>Gone are the days of asking for a magic pill and receiving it. Now, if you demand medication, you'll have to try SSRIs first&#8202;-&#8202;even if you have no symptoms of depression. If you push hard enough, you might get to try glorified Benadryl (a.k.a. Hydroxyzine) before a benzodiazepine will even be considered.</p> <p>You'll have to prove that your mental health is really in shambles&#8202;-&#8202;and when you try, technological advances in medicine will be there to put you in your place and to remind you to meditate your troubles away.
